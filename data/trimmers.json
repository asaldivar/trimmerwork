I feel I would be a great addition to your company because I already have some experience trimming as well as making oils.\t\t\t\r\nNow as for some of my experience in this industry, I have done some trimming/making oil as well as up keeping plants here and there for friends and family. Now although I don’t have any experience as a bud-tender  I feel I have more knowledge about the plant then just the casual user so I am confident I will be able to help your customer with whatever they need and why. Whether it’s smoking and eating edibles for the casual enthusiasts or to help someone with a medical issue. For example, if someone tends to be out and about a lot and wants to stay productive I would personally point them in the direction of a sativa or sativa-dom hybrid. Or maybe it’s a medical issue? Maybe someone finds they dip in and out of depression because of a medical issue or do to the season change. In either case I would recommend a good sativa. (I.e. Hippie Crippler/Sour Diesel/Cinex/Agent Orange etc…). And sometimes a customer may not even like smoking or getting high, in which case I would recommend some CBD oil for a vape pen or maybe even some CBD capsules/edibles that are 100% CBD with no THC for zero psychoactive effects. \r\nIn Conclusion, I feel I would be a great addition to the team because this is a job I genuinely have a passion for and really want to soak up as much knowledge about! I’ll be one of your hardest workers, most knowledgeable as well as outgoing and friendly with customers and team mates!

I have a passion for marijuana that I would love to eventually develop into a career. \r\nI would need housing accommodations with a cannabis trimming position, but I do have my own vehicle, valid drivers license and a marijuana workers permit. I would like a position that starts ASAP and ends around the holidays, but I am very flexible on my time frame. \r\nPlease email me if you have any positions available. I'm confident I would make an excellent addition to your team.","trimmer_contact":"Please contact me at sjs393@nau.edu or call me at 623-606-0545","date":"2017-10-04T22:12:09.162Z"},{"_id":"7a29c660-a952-11e7-9a7d-c99de06bb99b","trimmer_name":"Jack Hibben","trimmer_location":"Los Angeles","skill_level":"Mid","references":"true","accommodations":"false","work_type":"Full-time","cover_letter":"Located in Los Angeles, specifically the San Fernando valley, I have been trimming for several years both outdoor and indoor.

I believe I am an excellent candidate to work with your company as I have experience in the cannabis industry, social media, retail, excellent customer service, administrative work, team leading, training, hiring, group and teamwork, and multitasking.\r\n\r\nFor the past three months, I have been working in a dispensary where I educated myself in the cannabis industry with regards to strains, products, inventory, METRC, and a BIOtrack POS system. I have been handling a high volume of customers while simultaneously exchanging exceptional customer service skills and helping customers choose the best product for them. On a daily basis, I have been keeping up-to-date with news, articles, and information regarding new products and regulation changes. I have been handling products safely and in a clean manner during operating and opening/closing hours.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years, I have experienced working in the food industry, with a high volume of multi- tasking, organization, creativity, and working under pressure. I handled food preparation and design, social media, advertising strategies, handling the register, and inventory. This job has given me the opportunity to learn how to work under pressure at a high speed, to maintain a positive attitude, to be accurate and efficient, and to pay attention to detail. I have had the opportunity to build excellent customer-relations skills as well.\r\n\r\nFor four months, my experience in promoting and marketing has given me the chance to excel at sales, build customer-salesperson relationships, train and teach employees, work under high amount of pressure, and meet goals daily.\r\n\r\nIn my one-year experience in retail as a Sales Lead at Ann Taylor and Sales Associate at American Eagle, New York, I worked on improving my sales, team leading, organization, time-management, and customer service skills. I always welcome any new occupation/industry to increase my knowledge and education.\r\n\r\nIn my two years experience as an Assistant Producer in New TV, Lebanon, I worked in a high-pressured, fast- paced national television station where I interacted with national celebrities, program hosts, producers, cast, and crew. I worked in pre-production, production, and post-production of a social issues program. I improved my administrative, multitasking, customer service, research, and organizational skills where I followed up with all necessary steps for successful shows.\r\n\r\nI hope you give me the chance to prove I will be an important addition to your respectable establishment. I let my hard work speak for itself, as I believe in giving my all in any job or position. I am a fast-learner and am capable of adapting myself to any environment.\r\n\r\nIf interested, please do contact me at (347) 822-5737. I look forward to hearing from you.

My name is Ryan Markuson and I am very excited to hear about your job opening! A little about me, I was born in Portland and raised in Oregon City where I graduated in 2014. I am currently a term away from my transfer’s degree where I will then attend OSU online and complete my bachelor degree in horticulture. For the past year, Lotus Family Farms has been growing on my family's 4th generational 90 acre farm under the supervision of master grower Ilo Ferroggiaro. I have been his understudy for the last season and have managed 2,500 hundreds plants with Ilo and another grow assistant. The reason I am looking for work elsewhere is because your facility is much closer to where my classes are, and I take my education very seriously. I am used to hard work and have the back to keep up. I am a 6 ft. 7 in. male, and I have spent all my summers growing up as a farm hand on my family's farm, and am used to the farm work style. I have experience in mixing soil, transplanting, tea brewing, wet and dry feeding, foliar spraying, dead/big leafing, looking for pests and plant deficiency's, ppm/PH readings, and running irrigation lines. I have more experience growing than I do trimming, but I am a quick learner. I really hope to hear from you soon! Thank you for the consideration.

At this moment I live in Brooklyn, NY and will be moving to Los Angeles within a month or two, or as soon as i can secure a job. I am currently employed by SNL Construction LLC, a construction company that builds storage buildings, as an assistant superintendent. Before this job three years ago, I worked in a homemade wine center as a winemaker. I believe my skills that I’ve gained at these jobs will make me an ideal candidate for one of your positions you’re seeking to fill. \r\nAs an Assistant Superintendent, I have developed stronger leadership and communication skills. I understand the large importance of deadlines and following the plans/instructions, especially when dealing with local laws and codes. I also understand the how important a goal oriented team really is when working together. Record keeping and organization skills are necessary as many logs are needed to be kept up on a daily basis. Quality control in all building aspects must be kept up to par too. \r\nWhile working in the winery, there was one main rule that had to be followed; Cleanliness is key. If the supplies weren’t sanitized completely there would run a risk of poor wine quality or a lower yield. I understand how important it is to have all materials cleaned and fully sanitized before continuing with the process, as it is a vital step\r\nBoth of these jobs also fed into my love for hands on work. I feel that I thrive at whatever job I do when I’m physically able to make it or watch it grow. I am more than confident that I can be a major part of your team at your company. Any kind of work that is hands on, I do extremely well with. I would be extremely stoked to learn so much about a growing industry that I’m so interested in. A position in this field would truly support my passion for hands-on type of work. I certainly look forward to hearing from you. \r\nThankyou for your time\r\nDouglas Conran","trimmer_contact":"douglasmconran@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T12:28:39.241Z"},{"_id":"3e779df0-acee-11e7-a70c-e7da05d06b40","trimmer_name":"Sara Kelley","trimmer_location":"Medford","skill_level":"Entry","certification":"false","references":"true","accommodations":"true","work_type":"Full-time","cover_letter":"I have trimmed off and on helping friends for the last 5 years I am new to the area of medford I don't have a stable place to live yet that is why I am seeking work at this time I am using transit for transportation I am highly energetic and enthusiastic hard worker that can multi task I believe I can say safely that I can trim two pounds a day if not more need to find work","trimmer_contact":"beautifuldisaster9302@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T12:34:51.221Z"},{"_id":"8137aac0-acfa-11e7-a70c-e7da05d06b40","trimmer_name":"Tim Guffey","trimmer_location":"Oregon city","skill_level":"Senior","certification":"true","references":"true","accommodations":"false","work_type":"Full-time","cover_letter":"I've been wet/dry trimming for 18 yrs..i developed the name Guffd Up..by listening to orders, then following them precisely...I use to contract myself out to prep/trim/clean up/ clean/ transplant/ net or cage/ flip em..then..take cuttings....I have an incredible eye for detail( pest prevenative, plant def.) and take being on time everyday serious..I have 2 daughters and am a single dad..I had a ommp lic.

If any spot available for tent for few days id pitch until I could get into some other place.

I graduated as a student athlete from the University of Arizona where the use of cannabis was obviously prohibited. After seeing the effectiveness of CBD on my autistic brother, I decided I wanted a career in the cannabis industry. \r\n\r\nI currently am a Manager for Fresh Flowers Collective in Los Angeles. With the help of an additional manager, we manage the daily operations of the shop. We make sure all inventory is fully tracked and supplied, create monthly schedules for the 10+ employees that we have, and come up with effective marketing strategies to increase foot traffic. I also helped create SOPs for a few of the different processes that we have including, Budtending and Sales, Patient Intake, Vendor Intake, Security Protocols, and Inventory management. Cannabis is an extreme passion of mine and I am looking to make a career out of it. \r\n\r\nIf you take a look at my resume you will also see that I was previously an Operations Supervisor for Damco Distribution. I managed up to 75 people for customers like, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Nestle Waters of America, and Home Depot. I was responsible for the safety of the shift as a whole and making sure that we hit our production goals set by the facility director.\r\n\r\nWhile I was attending Community College, I was also a manager for a local delivery service called Fast Greens. I had a very close relationship with the owner and I gained more and more responsibilities as time went on. I started off by making sure the recommendations were valid and by the time I was leaving to college I was holding interviews with potential employees. \r\n\r\nMy true passion is with growing. When I saw the night and day difference in my brother's behavior, I started researching cannabis and how the plant grows. When I discovered the endless possibilities of breeding cannabis, I decided to start growing. I have been doing so for a little more than 3.5 years now. I am constantly trying to improve yield and phenohunt for the best strains. I have studied and read many articles and books on growing but I still have a lot to learn.\r\n\r\nIf offered a position, I have no issues with scheduling and can work anytime. I have attached my resume below but please feel free to call me anytime at (760) 953-3290. Thank you for your time and consideration! \r\n\r\n- Kaige Lawrence","trimmer_contact":"kaige99@live.com","date":"2017-10-09T19:28:25.299Z"},{"_id":"38dcd370-ad29-11e7-ba60-73e6ff6c9850","trimmer_name":"Nicholas Sexton","trimmer_location":"Redding ca","skill_level":"Entry","certification":"true","references":"true","accommodations":"true","work_type":"Full-time","cover_letter":"Hi my name is Nicholas Sexton I'm from Phoenix Arizona I just moved to Redding CA to stay with my brother ive heard about jobs like this in northern CA but thought it was to good to be true IAM a very hard worker that would love to experience this so much","trimmer_contact":"nics31098@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T19:37:02.192Z"},{"_id":"f3f62a30-ad29-11e7-ba60-73e6ff6c9850","trimmer_name":"Dan Bell","trimmer_location":"central point","skill_level":"Senior","certification":"false","references":"true","accommodations":"false","work_type":"Full-time","cover_letter":"Hey there.

I've continuously remained employed within the industry since then, gaining familiarity in a wide variety of roles and responsibilities common to a dispensary's day-to-day operations. I possess not only sales, clerical, and administrative experience in a dispensary setting but also insight and advanced knowledge of the cannabis plant and genetics accumulated over ten years of refining growing methods, researching new techniques, and continuously learning through trial and error in the process of commercially cultivating cannabis plants in mid to large-scale growing gardens & warehouses.\r\n \r\n I have served a variety of leadership and management roles in the fast-paced start-up environment of dispensaries that demanded accountability and proactive behavior. I have experience in recruiting, training, and supervising new employees on bud tending procedures, cashier operations, customer service protocols, safety standards, and our organization's mission & policies. Through collaborative team work and a proactive, organized approach, I've learned how to develop and manage an ambitious and energetic sales team that can efficiently meet sales quotas while prioritizing excellence in customer service and patient satisfaction through creative problem solving methods that best serve our customers. My experience has taught me the importance of establishing professional working relationships with patients.  I understand the value in delivering genuine and passionate customer service, both in terms of generating profit and also in establishing a strong brand image and favorable reputation propagated by satisfied customers.\r\n \r\nI consider myself a highly-receptive and adaptable individual familiar with the accountability and reliability expected from me by my employers. I am well researched in new growing techniques and possess insight to expand knowledge in determining appropriate nutrients for individual strains, high yield recipes, analyze controlled stress environments with variable ent lighting systems and set ups. I possess vast comprehensive knowledge of various strains, their effects and of the various types of medicinal administration methods. \r\n \r\nThe Cannabis industry has been a life-long passion for me, and I've made a living over the past decade employed within the industry while simultaneously gaining some degree of mastery in nearly every role within a dispensary's operational and growing staff. For all these reasons, I seek your active consideration of my application for a full-time position and look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

I started trimming my friends’ medical grows prior to recreational legalization and have worked for a friend’s recreational grow for the last year.  I have an OLCC marijuana workers permit.\r\n\r\nI have experience stalk trimming fresh cut colas, fine trimming fan and sugar leaves and cutting out peteals.  With this method, I have mostly hung the colas to cure, then de-stem the flowers as the colas approach the grower’s desired level of moisture content.  I then de-stem the flowers and clean up any sugar leaves from the flowers.  All trim is kept for processing.  I have used this method mainly in smaller grow operations.\r\n\r\nI also have experience dry trimming.  This usually entails cutting down plants and cutting/stripping fan leaves and leaving the flowers on the stem for curing.  After the flowers are cured, the flowers are de-stemmed and then fine trimmed.  I have used this trimming method for larger commercial grows.\r\n\r\nI have used various trimming machines as well, most notably the Triminator.  I have only used this at larger commercial grows.  Medical (prior to rule changes)  and smaller grow operations tend not to use them in my experience and those growers fear the machines adversely affect the final product.  At larger grows, it isn’t economically viable to hand trim everything start to finish, especially due to the flooded market here in Oregon.\r\n\r\nI know that different strains, growth methods and mediums can produce varying degrees of flower structure.  Some strains grow very dense flowers (gorilla glue #4 is a good example) and some are less dense (high CBD strains such as cannatonic for instance).  Knowing how to handle the differences between different strains/growing techniques is very important for the quality of the final product and efficacy for the grower themselves.  I hold myself to high standards in this regard.  \r\n\r\nI am also cognizant of not cross contaminating grow sites.  Powdery mildew, mites, potential hermaphroditing and pollen contamination are all important  to avoid so I always change clothing between sites.\r\n\r\nI have the ability to trim dry flower that has been de-stemmed at a rate of 1.5lbs/8 hour period give or take a few ounces depending on the density of the flower.  I stay on task and only stop to stretch or use the restroom.","trimmer_contact":"erik.blindnil@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-13T19:37:52.499Z"},{"_id":"f2caee60-b04f-11e7-a288-11368df4174b","trimmer_name":"Todd Saed","trimmer_location":"Cave Junction OR","skill_level":"Entry","certification":"true","references":"true","accommodations":"false","work_type":"Part-time","cover_letter":"I am responding to the craigslist ad.\r\nI am studying growweedeasy.com to find current trends, and have experience\r\ngrowing a little at home,  and use.

I am interested in working in the cannabis industry because I believe cannabis as a commodity carries sufficient strength/force to make total national legalization a reality. For the past year I have worked in the cannabis industry for Sho Products/Rosin Tech. Sho products specializes on heat presses and so call \" solvent-less extraction\". Under this company my  main duties were to assemble and manufacture heat presses and pollen extraction machines ( tumblers). In the past three months, I was responsible for building Sho products' new press the Rosin Roller under the Sho Industries brand. The Rosin Roller's retail price was  $ 7,000, and it was considered to be the new innovation in solvent-less extraction. .  I also helped with shipping and organizing merchandise in the main distribution  warehouse. I worked  trade shows such as High Times' Cannabis Cub, Champs, Emerald Cup, and Chalice.   My responsibilities during the trade shows were to interact and inform costumers about extraction machines and perform  live rosin extraction using heat presses. I also helped with set up and break down of tents and equipment. Due to  Sho Products' small staff  I was able to gain experience in several other  sectors: from costumer service, manufacturing, stocking,  picking and organizing out going orders,taking inventory and shipping orders  using software such as Google Docs, spread sheet, and  shipstation. I also possess Microsoft office knowledge ( mainly word, excel, and power point); not to mention that I am always incline to learn new software when ever the opportunity to do so presents itself. I also consider myself computer savvy.  Because such limited staff, I was expected to do perform different task and prioritize urgent requests. I left my former Job with Rosin Tech because I desire to work on the field. I also desire to learn as much as possible abut the plant and to unlock its potential. I am open for full-time, seasonal, or part time work.  Finally I am a long time Martial Arts practitioner(  Jiu Jitsu and wrestling)  which have though me discipline,commitment and self-composure. I hope you give me the opportunity to further discuss details  regarding this employment opportunity.

We sold it as caring for my ailing mother (with whom I shared ownership of property) became impossible at home and she needed her share of proceeds to pay for a long term facility. \r\n\r\nWe are well versed in all aspects of marijuana growing from cloning to planting through packaging and sale. As former growers ourselves, we understand what goes into each plant and the importance of trimming with care. Ensuring that only necessary cuts are made for optimal visual and olfactory appeal as well health and quality of the plant is key to efficacy and waste management. Additionally, we just love the whole process of marijuana cultivation and miss it fiercely. We are exclusively seeking work at the same farm as we are a one vehicle family and we enjoy working with one another. \r\n\r\nWe grew our farm from 12 plants the first season to 48 plants the last season. Had we not sold, this year would have been the first to require additional help as our growth plan was for 72 plants. We did not work for anyone nor employ anyone, as such, professional references may pose a challenge. However, our knowledge and experience would easily be ascertained through the interview process. \r\n\r\nWe really just want to get back to what  we know and love and hope to find a farm we can invest our time and energy  in, gaining a vested interest in the life and peace giving medicine together.\r\n\r\nWe are available immediately, can work any shift, any number of hours, holidays and weekends.","trimmer_contact":"Moandmattross@gmail.com","date":"2017-11-05T01:43:28.160Z"}]
