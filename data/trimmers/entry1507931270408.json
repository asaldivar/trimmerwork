So long enough to get the hang of it.  I was also doing harvesting as well so not all trimming.  The trim manager had the impression that I was moving in on his gf so I had to go.  Looking to get back out there tho.  Currently in a hotel looking for a place to live but if you offer shelter I will take it.  If not that's fine too.","contact":"bgrist309@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-13T21:47:50.407Z"}
