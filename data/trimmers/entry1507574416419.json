I can trim, grow, and make extracts. even dabbled in making medibles, and butter. Bud-tending was my main responsibility, but I would also evaluate incoming product, and assess quality. I also had a side business delivering medical product to disabled people who could not make it in themselves. I have a sincere passion for this new industry, and feel I would be a very valuable asset to any organization. Thank you for your time, and have a great day!","contact":"480-227-4912 is my phone. bcnewbold@hotmail.com is my email. Feel free to use either.","date":"2017-10-09T18:40:16.418Z"}
