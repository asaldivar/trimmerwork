I have spent the last 3 years polishing my skills as a budtender, receptionist, delivery manager, and social media manager.  I have and constantly seek more knowledge on different types of strains and their uses, different types of medicine, vaping, concentrates, benefits and uses of CBD and what it is, and different ways to medicate. I am up to date with everything on the market and am eager to hear back feedback from patients. My experiences in the community these last 5 years have driven me to put my skills to the admin side of the cannabis industry- as my personal life consists of many of the duties listed in the job description. I'm constantly researching new products or information and determining how different people feel about it, and most importantly understanding why. \r\n\r\nMy most recent job was in a pre ICO dispensary where I was a full time budtender. I also trimmed when I wasn't on shift to make extra money. I am aware of and respect all MMJ etiquette. I have also worked for a delivery service as the delivery manager, administrative assistant to a grower's association, and as the receptionist. I've been in the community working various roles and gaining different experiences continuously for the last 3 years. I have experience with updating social media and editing Weedmaps pages, as well as general maintenance of online platforms. I was responsible for social media and Weedmaps at 2 of the shops I've worked at. My college degree and (boring) history with office jobs have also given me the opportunity to have strong Excel and data entry skills, as well as polished phone and email etiquette","contact":"Ncpapazian@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-04T20:58:02.954Z"}
