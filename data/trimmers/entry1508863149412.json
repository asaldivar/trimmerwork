My heart has been called to the Emerald Triangle. I have donated most of my belongings and am headed west to seek work in California. I am very aware of the devastation due to the recent fires, and I want to help in any way that I can. I am an experienced grower and trimmer. I have personal references that I can provide at anytime. I am interested in trimming, yes, but am also interested in any part of the growing operation aside from sales. I also am very interested in clean up efforts from recent fires. I only say all of this because I enjoy being with the plant. While fully capable of sales, I'd rather 'get my hands dirty' behind the scenes. About me: I am a very intuitive and intelligent individual who loves to learn new things, and loves new adventures. I will be traveling solo, and own next to nothing aside from my car and a few necessities, so food and housing would be a major plus, but isn't a requirement. Take care and I hope to hear from you soon!","contact":"tblatnick@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-24T16:39:09.412Z"}
