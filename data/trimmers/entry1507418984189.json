I am a freelance designer and illustrator living in the Portland area. I want to work in the cannabis industry because I am passionate about keeping weed legal and informing the public about its benefits. I have smoked cannabis for years and would be a beginner trimmer. But I am a hard worker and faster learner who loves a challenge. I have taken and passed the OLCC Recreational Marijuana worker permit test and am ready to being work in the cannabis industry.\r\nThank you for your time, consideration and have a great day.","contact":"rachael.a.bentz@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-07T23:29:44.188Z"}
