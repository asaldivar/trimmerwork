Out of those 8 years, 1 of those years I did 3, 60 plant harvests. So I have a little bit of experience in trimming, but always willing to learn! I've never used any machines to trim, only the old school way sitting around a dining room table cutting away with scissors. I would be able to assist with everything from pre-grow setup to post harvest if needed. As far as accommodations goes it would depend on where the job is located, if shelter and food are provided that would be great! If shelter and food are not provided a means to post up camp or find shelter would be great. I am available full time as of now!","contact":"chitownsoundguy@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T20:46:17.568Z"}
