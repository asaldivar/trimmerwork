I have experience with greenhouse care, planting, bucking down, trimming, and some nutrient/feeding experience.\r\nI am looking for a place to work with for years to come. I am deeply passionate about plants and plant care. I am enthusiastic and have a huge customer serivice background.  I would like to be very hands on to get the most out of everything I am taught. \r\nI have a working vehicle and a 215 card and am willing to drive if necessary with accommodations for gas.\r\na place nearby to stay and cook would be the best option for me, if needed to stay long term or far from my place of residence. \r\nThank you for your consideration! Hope to hear from you soon.","contact":"Beccahedges@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-07T21:48:50.077Z"}
