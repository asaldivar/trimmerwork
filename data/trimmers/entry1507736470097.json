I'm trained in farm work. I've been picking grapes in Baja Cali for 10 years. I'm also trained in winemaking but I want to make money trimming during the harvest season.  I prefer California more than anywhere else.\r\nI do need shelter accommodations and perhaps one meal a day.\r\nI'm a very hard working man and I can work for extended periods of time. Up to 16hrs.
