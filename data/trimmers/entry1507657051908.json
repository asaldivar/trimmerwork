I know what a hard day of work is and how to get things done. I have held manager positions as well as being a team and squad leader while in the service. My bother has been out working in Humboldt county for some time now, and I have been wanting to come work for a very long time. I have done some minor trimming but nothing major but I am trying to learn this industry inside and out. My goal is to become a main grower but I know I have to start at the bottom and prove myself. So if you are looking for a young hard working man who's not afraid to get his hands dirty and break his back to do what is needed them I am your guy.","contact":"Murphy.richards@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-10T17:37:31.908Z"}
