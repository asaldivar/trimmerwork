I'm staying in Portland until mid-November with some friends and was looking to work for a bit before I head back for school. I've been growing Cannabis for 3 years and I've been trimming for about 5. I don't need any accommodation other than a decent pair of trimmers! I'm far from lazy, don't complain, and am always grateful! Pretty excited to head back to my grow back in the District, but I'd love to put some work in while I'm out West!","contact":"Please email me at DDH693@icloud.com or by phone at 7037956316","date":"2017-10-08T21:52:15.430Z"}
