I've only had experience trimming two personal outdoor grows, but I found the work and experience to be very enjoyable. Now that legal marijuana has arrived in California, I would love to get into this kind of work.I'm introverted but very easy to get along with.  I take direction well, and I'm very punctual. I am looking to work part time (30 hours a week) and have a very open schedule. Thank you for considering me!","contact":"danielshear@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T20:25:35.110Z"}
