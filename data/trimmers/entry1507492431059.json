Have a truck I use as a mobile camp and a tent that, if there is any space still available, I would like to be able to set up to live-work at & around the harvest area. I can cover my own meals as I have a portable stove setup, but any meals provided would be appreciated. I'm used to doing early morning farm work thru a number of WWOOF gigs, and would be available from early in the morning(8am) to midevening (6pm) for various task.","contact":"zerifeari@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-08T19:53:51.059Z"}
