I have a passion for medicine, and am an adaptable worker with values in critical thinking and integrity. My apprenticeship under various growers for the past eight years has given me the confidence and dexterity to carry out any given task in the cannabis production cycle, in both outdoor and state of the art indoor environments. I also have knowledge in extractions, from ice water to closed system. \r\n\r\nI am low maintence and drama-free. My intention is to act professionally while maintainig an amiable presence. \r\n\r\nI have all of the neccesarry camping equipment and experience to be self-sufficient. Ideally I would like to be accomodated, but I can also work for the day and leave as I have the option of borrowing a car.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration. References are available upon request.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n       -Johan","contact":"Please contact via call/text at (503)-459-8502 OR at Johannbach88@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-08T01:04:43.661Z"}
