My name is Erik and I have been in the cannabis industry for a couple of years now. I am a grower, and I the owner of the BoyScoutCookies (https://www.instagram.com/boyscoutcookies/) brand, which I believe would also bring value to your farm/company. I am now traveling the states, currently finished working on a farm in the Rogue River area, and I am searching for more work before I head back to Europe. I am remote, with transportation. Looking mainly for trimming.\r\nIf needed, I may provide recommendations from major cannabis brands that I have worked with.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time, and please contact me anytime.","contact":"gscookiesofficial@gmail.com","date":"2017-11-05T02:00:04.608Z"}
