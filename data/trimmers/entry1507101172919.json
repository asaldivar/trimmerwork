I can start anytime and would like to work with a team that has experience so that I have a mentor to teach me and help me if I'm stuck. My fiancee Brandon Halberg is also applying and it would be easier to work with him since we do carpool.","contact":"sonya@garbercentral.com","date":"2017-10-04T07:12:52.919Z"}
