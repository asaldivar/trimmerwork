I have my own supplies, scissors, apron, tray & basket. Can provide food, I have tent and sleeping accommodations but would love to be off the ground. I have a reliable 4x4 vehicle. Prefer to get 200 a lb for quality bud, but will do 175 & 150. I can identify many strains and love cannabis and the healing aspects.","contact":"5305144125","date":"2017-10-10T19:03:38.711Z"}
