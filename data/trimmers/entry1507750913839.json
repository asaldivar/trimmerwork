I needed to get out of my hometown and get into the weed world! I had a job lined up to work, but decided today not to follow through. The owner of the farm has surpassed the creepy level and i don't feel comfortable going there. I am traveling with two dogs - both extremely well trained. (They literally just sleep at my feet while working. ) I've got years of experience in the weighing industry - not so much in the trimming industry. I'm willing to work sun up to sun down - paid per lb. I'm a hard worker and i'm eager to start! (can start asap) I really just need someone to take a chance on me & help me restart up my life out west. ( Also have 4 years of sales experience - looking to transfer into the sales representative field once in the community. ) Thank you in advance!
