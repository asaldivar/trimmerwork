I have experience trimming from my own cannabis growing while living in Boulder, Colorado. I have completed a number of outdoor grows as well as indoor and have trimmed pounds at a time. I am fit to work, have a good work ethic and pace, and am very excited about the emerging cannabis industry in California. Looking for work during the outdoor harvest season and possibly into the winter months if indoor is an option.","contact":"ara_verbano89@hotmail.com","date":"2017-10-15T02:42:56.758Z"}
