I'm currently employed with the same company for almost 12 years now. In this time I've acquired leadership skills, some electrical training, 40 ton overhead crane training, I was on the Safety Committee for years, attended safety awareness and training seminars, and CPR and first response training. However due to some unforeseen circumstances my company May no longer be in business. I'm a hard worker dedicated and passionate about my work. I have reliable transportation and I am used to working long hours. I'm not just looking for a job I'm looking for a long time investment with a great company I can call home. I'm a husband and a father just looking to provide for my family. I'm an honest man looking to put in some hard work and dedication to be a value to another great company. Also a team player and I work very well with others and I can work alone as well. I need year-round consistent work. I'm always up for a challenge and ready to work. I'm always ready to start as early as 5 a.m. and I can work as many hours as I'm allowed. If you are looking for someone like myself to be a part of your team, then please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you so much.","contact":"Bryanleasure1911@gmail.Com text@ 541-778-5278","date":"2017-10-06T00:06:48.611Z"}
