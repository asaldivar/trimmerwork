I work for mammoth and fix snowboards and skis so I'm good with my hands and am quick as well. Looking for someplace that will let me camp or has got some bunks or whatever. If foods included that's cool. I'm super positive and outgoing and will make sure everyone has a smile on their face. I'm available October and November. I hope you have the best day ever!","contact":"Kendrick@gaussoin.com","date":"2017-10-18T18:45:16.208Z"}
