My name is Julian Morales, and I am very interested in any position In trimming. If a position is still available I would absolutely love the opportunity to work for you. I do have a valid Medical Marijuana doctor's recommendation as well as a California Drivers License, my own vehicle, I am willing to drive as I currently reside in Anaheim, and I am 19 years of age. \r\n\r\nI am an experienced Budtender, and knowledgeable about cannabis, its effects, strains, ways of medicating, different products etc... as well as local, state and federal laws regarding medicinal and recreational marijuana. \r\n\r\nI would be PERFECT for this position because I am very passionate about marijuana as a medical aid. I find it to be an extremely effective alternative to alleviate discomfort from a patient's life. My passion for this as well as knowledge, understanding nature, customer service skills, and experience in the Medical Marijuana Industry makes me a great person for this job even if it is only trimming. The attention to detail and care about the plant is important when trimming. People put a lot of care into growing the medicine, so efficient care should be applied when trimming as well.\r\n\r\nIf I am given the position, I will be available weekdays after 6pm I can work any day  and can start whenever you need me. I look very forward to hearing from you! \r\n\r\nThank you!","contact":"Jm145995@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-29T19:20:35.829Z"}
