Hard-working, dependable, honest, focused, and drug-free (except 420 and coffee). I average around 2 lbs/day, more or less, depending on the quality of the product. I am mostly autonomous (have reliable transportation, backpacking equipment, etc). Access to showers, food, and a roof would be great, but are not necessary. Friendly, easygoing, and fun, but work comes first! Cheers!","contact":"774-526-3900","date":"2017-10-05T21:42:32.019Z"}
