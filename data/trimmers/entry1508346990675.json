I moved to Los Angeles from New York 2 years ago to pursue a career with medical marijuana, and one day make my own dispensary to help patients and smokers alike. I want the MMJ industry to thrive and I want to be apart of it, as it has helped me with my epilepsy a great deal too. I have no professional expirience but am definitely willing to learn. You can call me back at 562 385 4179. Thanks for your time and have a great day!!!\r\n\r\nP.s.- My new adress is 737 south boyle ave, Los Angeles , CA 90023\r\nAnd I am available on fulltime, weekends, and holidays too.","contact":"562 385 4179","date":"2017-10-18T17:16:30.675Z"}
