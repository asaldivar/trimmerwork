My name is Amy. I was born and raised in the community. I think my first time trimming was when I was 16. I'm comfortable with the work and the community. \r\n\r\nI work a normal retail job so ideally I'd like to supplement my existing schedule with smaller jobs or in the Eureka area. I don't have a car due to a car accident so hopefully we can find arrangements or work in the Eureka/Arcata area","contact":"myricka1@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-10T20:55:17.031Z"}
