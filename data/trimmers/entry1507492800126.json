I've been in the industry for 5 + years. I've managed a couple trim teams for large medical marijuana warehouses as many as four warehouses at a time. Usually putting out 50-90lb rooms with a solid team, mostly women. I prefer to keep a small circle, and have found its best that way for me.  I prefer the trimming position but also have experience with packaging, defoliating, and other garden work. I'm very passionate with my work and well organized. \r\nI've been in the marketing business before I got into the MMJ business, but fell in love with it instantly and haven't gone back to marketing. I'm currently living in north Hollywood arts district. Please give me a call or contact me via email if interested. \r\nThank you \r\nJenn \r\n8057148265","contact":"Wubbbz805@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-08T20:00:00.126Z"}
