I don't have much experience with trimming. However, I have been practicing with friends and am quickly picking it up. I am a fast learner and a team player. Willing to put in 12 hour days. I am used to working multiple jobs at once and am competent to get the work done. Would appreciate a parking spot or camping spot for sleeping and cooking meals. All the best!","contact":"macsullivan11@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-05T22:03:45.345Z"}
