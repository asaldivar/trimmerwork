I don't need any accommodations, but would be open to full-time onsite. I have everything I need to camp anywhere. I also have a car, and a place in Arcata. Never trimmed (to be fair I've trimmed all sorts of other plants) but I'm an efficient, focused worker and I learn very quickly. I'm also a very respectful, affable, and easy-going person. \r\n\r\nI can start immediately and work any schedule, I will be living here for a couple years so I'd be interested in a continuing working relationship if possible. I have much experience in biology, especially mycology, and have culturing and mushroom cultivation skills. I'd love to teach you how to produce more onsite using fungi as an ally. I'm also an avid backpacker and ukuleleist.","contact":"Please email at ksmighell@gmail.com or call 425-870-6597","date":"2017-10-13T17:45:15.601Z"}
