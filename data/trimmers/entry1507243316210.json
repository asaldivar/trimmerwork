My speed is roughly 65 grams an hour for most typical small nug strains, Can be much quicker on less demanding strains or larger buds.  I have transportation and would like a job that i can drive to and from. I can easily work 10-12 hour days during the week. If I worked over the weekend I can stay on sight and work 16 hours a day.
