I started out trimming every season and moved up to wholesale distribution. I didn't intend on trimming this year, however I just couldn't see myself sitting out. It's part of who I am!\r\n\r\nI am heading to Arcata at the date of this submission. I will have a tent and sleeping bag. I'm very flexible with accommodations. If I'm paid daily I do not mind feeding myself.\r\n\r\nI can clear two lbs of outdoor a day. I am used to committing to 14-16 hour days with limited breaks. I take trimming very seriously and work well with other like minded workers.","contact":"Whatanothermanspills@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-08T16:12:33.328Z"}
