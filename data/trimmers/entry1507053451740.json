I also have two or so years of managing a cannabis farm. (I grew up in a small farm as well) I enjoy the environment and the people within the cannabis industry and am really striving for a career in the field. I average two plus pounds a day of dense nug material. I hope this has been enough to entice you to pick me up. \r\nThank you,\r\nKenneth Eslinger\r\n781-656-4636","contact":"I prefer text message but calls are okay too. @781-656-4636","date":"2017-10-03T17:57:31.740Z"}
