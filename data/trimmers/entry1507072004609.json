Since then I have gathered little over 2 weeks of experience with trimming and packaging, so I am a newbie to the industry. That being said my drive and work ethic are seldom rivaled. I have been promoted/trusted with more responsibility at every job I've ever had, and now I'm setting my sights on this budding industry. Give me a chance to show you my character and ability to quickly adapt to new things.","contact":"twilliams1a@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T23:06:44.609Z"}
