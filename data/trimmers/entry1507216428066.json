I currently have an OLLC Worker Permit application ID #, permit is in processing. Cannabis is the future and I would like the opportunity to join this growing industry to help your business further flourish.\r\n     Being my own business owner for over ten years has taught me many valuable skills. Accomplishing projects in a detail oriented and efficient minded manner. Working with employees to create a happy, safe, enjoyable, team based workplace. Taking on problems and creating positive solutions. Listening to others concerns and addressing them. Talking with customers to ensure 100% satisfaction. Applying common sense and picking up on new tasks quickly. I believe all of these attributes will be beneficial to your business.\r\n     I currently do not have any experience trimming or processing. I do excel at picking up on new tasks quickly, being highly efficient, self-sufficient and hardworking 100% of the time I have reliable transportation and am always punctual.
