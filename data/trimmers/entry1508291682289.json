Work tasks that I would complete on a daily basis were, trimming( i can trim 1-2lbs a day), harvesting, watering plants, planting into different beds of soil, removing excess leaves and dead leaves. I have a vehicle for transport with my wife, we don't mind camping but a room would also be helpful if possible, all we would really ask for is a place to store food and a place to shower. I have availability from November 10th - All January. I can work long hours and stand on my feet for long hours. We are very hard working, passionate, and trustworthy people looking for an opportunity to grow in the cannabis industry.","contact":"Ulloalordan@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-18T01:54:42.286Z"}
