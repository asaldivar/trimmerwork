Occasionally, I would get sent out to grows to trim in outdoor environments, sometimes in adverse weather.  Now I am a summer seasonal trail worker for the National Park Service.  I believe that the combination of experience gained from these two jobs have given me the integrity and diligence to be an excellent trimmer as well as a diverse skill set allowing me to be useful for more duties aside from trimming.  I understand the care and respect that goes into handling the products as well as the efficiency and work ethic needed to produce as much as possible. Hiring me means gaining a motivated employee that is interested in creating a fun and professional environment and who is interested in encouraging others to be their best.","contact":"gloria.a.parker@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-13T20:16:19.474Z"}
