I am currently trimming in hood river or at frontier farms but my position will be ending next month and I am trying to travel to wherever there is work! I average 450-1500g in an 8 hr shift depending on the strain. I am a hard worker who likes to throw some headphones on and go! The only accommodation I might need would be housing, but I am very flexible on that and can accommodate myself if needed.","contact":"You can contact me at 4065703647 or by email at hashly5392@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-22T17:10:29.080Z"}
