During trimming season he recruits several people to work for him. Sadly I've only got the opportunity to work with him once, due to my busy schedule. Recently I got laid off my full time job and I'm interesting in a part time job as a trimmer. I am a responsible, fast learner, detailed, trustworthy, hard working person. I hope hearing back from you guys soon.","contact":"Medina.e0026@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-04T18:19:47.907Z"}
