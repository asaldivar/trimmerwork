My family and I are relocating to California. I am looking for work as soon as possible. I am in my 40's reliable, trustworthy, and not interested in anything shady. I am a quick learner and understand everyone has their way that they prefer to do things. We are currently living in our van, shelter would be helpful until we can get a house. Thank you.
