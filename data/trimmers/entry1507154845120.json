I started trimming on a large outdoor medical garden in Mendocino, CA. Since then I have worked in small residential gardens, including my own and in large recreational warehouses. I have a good friend attitude and a great work ethic, long hours don't scare me. I am looking for full-time work, seasonal is ok but would prefer something long term.","contact":"daddymaxwell@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-04T22:07:25.119Z"}
