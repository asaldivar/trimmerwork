I can prob trim 2lb or so nicely in a day maybe more. My harvests are around 1.7lb and I finish that in about 6 hours or less while I do other things. I would be looking for just part time work. I work full time. But could come out at nights and weekends. I can obtain a card once I find a position.","contact":"Timmy.lucas.jr@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T22:57:20.275Z"}
