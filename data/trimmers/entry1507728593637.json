I've trimmed in past seasons -- depending on the strains, up to 3-4 lbs per day. I have a university background in sustainable horticulture and design. Depending on the site location, I would need somewhere to pitch a tent (I have a Honda Element - great for camping and hauling compost, vermiculite, etc!) and a more communal atmosphere would be ideal. I work best in environments that allow personal initiative and respect personal space, irregardless of race, religion, sex, gender, or orientation. Thanks for your time!","contact":"Cody.ingram@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-11T13:29:53.636Z"}
