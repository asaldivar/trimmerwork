To start I studied horticulture and continue to do so in my spare time. I have 6 seasons of trim experience as well as cultivation. I am detailed and can trim to any specification. I also have 8 years of landscaping experience including many nursury/green house projects and can do labor. I am drama free, get along with others, and prefer to keep my head down working. I have transportation and my own place to sleep. I Do need a kitchen to use and a bathroom/shower. Dinner would be great but not necessary. I am available to start work the 1st week of November and can continue as long as there is work. Thank You","contact":"Please contact me: 420delite@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-12T06:42:11.882Z"}
