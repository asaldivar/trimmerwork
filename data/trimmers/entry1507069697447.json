Currently I'm in the process of expanding, but state compliance takes time so I'm looking for full-time work in the meantime. Depending on quality, trimming 1lb/day shouldn't be a problem. I'm free now until Janurary so hopefully there is enough work! :) \r\n\r\nBless\r\n-Mikey Gray\r\n(772)342-5124","contact":"Mr.mikegrayjr@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T22:28:17.446Z"}
