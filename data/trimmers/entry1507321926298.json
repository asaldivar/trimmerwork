While managing a shop, we would trim flower before putting it on the shelves.  I would typically trim 2 to 3 pre-trimmed pounds per 9 hour day, while doing many other tasks. I have a strong passion for cannabis and hope to expand my skills in trimming this season. I am fully available for trim work and would prefer to be on the job site if possible. Although I do not have full trim experience, I believe I am still capable of flourishing in any cannabis environment due to my passion, fast learning capabilities, and positive energy!","contact":"starla225@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T20:32:06.298Z"}
