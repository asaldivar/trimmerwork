I have tended to the plant at every cycle of groth and have trimmed quite a few pounds over the years. I'm a 31 year old humble hippy down to the soul yet have also learned to adapt to the corprate world we live in. My hope is to find a grass roots company with good vaules to place an official foot in the canniabis industry. I have applied for a workers permit and awaiting approval. My application reference number is: 34312.  Thanks alot for your time and consideration and i hope to hear from you. \r\nMatthew E.
