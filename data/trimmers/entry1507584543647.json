I love to\r\neducate and talk about cannabis and get pleasure from helping people find the strain that is\r\nright for them. I don't accept the answer \"It's good\" when talking about cannabis because I am\r\nmore interested in what it does. I would show that same respect to my customers. I previously\r\nvolunteered at The World Famous Cannabis Club as a budtender, rolling joints, filling Volcano\r\nbags, loading bowls (bud and dabs) and cleaning pipes. I also perfected a brownie recipe for\r\npeople with social anxiety to help them go out and have a good time. Unfortunately I no longer\r\nhave access to that strain and it was nameless. I have learned a lot but am always looking to\r\nlearn more.\r\nI would love to have the opportunity to discuss my love of cannabis in person.\r\nthanks,\r\nJason Lingel","contact":"dragonlee2@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T21:29:03.647Z"}
