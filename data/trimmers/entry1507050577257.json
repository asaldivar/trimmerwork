I am proficient with performing many of the basic tasks necessary for a cultivator such as cloning, transplanting, feeding, pruning, training, harvest, and cure. I have shown the ability to nurture up to 25 plants from seed to harvest. \r\n\r\nCurrently, I am seeking to take my knowledge to the next level and gain hands-on experience working in a commercial cultivation environment. I am a coach-able team player and take to constructive criticism and instruction well. I have strong work ethics and believe in professionalism. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty and I am willing to put in the time and effort to hone my craft and further develop my skills as a grower. \r\n\r\nI can trim about 1 pound per day and do not require accommodations within the Los Angeles area. I am open and willing to travel.","contact":"Gcatoera@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T17:09:37.253Z"}
