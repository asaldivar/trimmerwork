Saturated my endocannabinoid system for most of it while being a private caretaker for a blind woman with arthritis. I came home to Ohio to be near family but the town i live in is a ghost town and my brother set his house on fire and my car along with it. I'm looking to move back out west and I have a flight voucher to get me there. I would love to work seasonally if not Full time, whatever is needed! I have no professional experience trimming but I have helped friends with their personal products and I work my parents vegetable garden and love to play in dirt. I have cared for young and old humans for well over 10 years, am a food bitch and cannabis cunt, so I am all about quality.\r\n\r\nI will need housing and transportation but besides that, I can take care of food.","contact":"440-992-3781 or erin.woot223@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T15:24:29.746Z"}
