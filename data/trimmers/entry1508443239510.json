Following a year spent looking after my sick mother in New Jersey, I moved to San Diego to pursue a career in the golf industry. I realized after 6 months that it was not the industry for me for a multitude of reasons. Now I turn the page and am eager to join an operation that I care about, and have enthusiasm for. I am a huge advocate for cannabis and it's plentiful healing characteristics, and how it will inevitably help diseases and addiction. I am well versed in working with a variety of people, and have learned how to communicate with people of all cultures through my work experiences and travels. I have 8 years of handling marijuana, as well as exposure to the grow process, however I have not yet physically gotten my hands dirty in an operation. I have landscape experience and a massive appreciation for plants and flowers. I have my own car and an open schedule. I look forward to having the opportunity to meet you\r\n\r\nThank you and best of luck in your search","contact":"kevinsmith0523@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-19T20:00:39.509Z"}
