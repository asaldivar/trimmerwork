I just completed my last day trimming at a medical grow and am now looking for solid work.  I have passed my OLCC workers permit test, as well as filed for my application, and am just waiting on the approval.  \r\n\r\n  I can usually trim a pound in 4-5 hours.  I know how to identify mold and I know the general terms used in the industry.  I really love working for production weight opposed to the hourly wage.  I am friendly, funny, focused, and detailed.  I go to work to make as much money as possible.  I show up when expected and work hard until I leave.  I have my own car, registered and insured, and a valid ODL.  I am looking to start working as soon as possible.  \r\n \r\n  The only time I am unavailable to work is every other weekend from Friday afternoon to Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\n If you're interested, please give me a call at (903)440-2576.  I am in the Rogue Valley.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nKelly Cole","contact":"Cell phone (903)440-2576","date":"2017-10-21T05:56:51.285Z"}
