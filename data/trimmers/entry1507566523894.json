So, I've been growing on and off for the past 15 years for personal use and experimentation (cloning, scroging, LST, temps, humidity levels etc... Agriculture has always been a hobby of mine so I do have some knowledge. I seriously want to get into the Medical Cannabis industry full-time as it is and always will be my passion. I am a team player ready and willing to give a 110 percent to assist with a strong team.\r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you,\r\nThx Steve  (available now)","contact":"looper76@msn.com","date":"2017-10-09T16:28:43.894Z"}
