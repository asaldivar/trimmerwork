Im a professional, a veteran that uses cannabis. But i do not smoke until night and my work is done. Im not interested in comming there for fun. I want to come just to work and catch up on some bills and get things for my daughters. I do need a place to stay, unless you're near grants pass or medford. Or i can rent a room there.  But I can bring a small bed. I can shop for my own food if its close, i have a car. Please consider mrle for the position,  i wont let you down.","contact":"Kahil275@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-10T14:53:03.220Z"}
