I have had a fruit and vegetable garden for the last few years. I also have a bonsai tree which I have to trim. I know it isn't the exact same thing, but plants are my passion. I will be a great student. I am coachable, easy going, and I take my craft seriously. I have a clean record and can get my OLCC license.  I will learn quickly and take criticism very well. Once you meet me you will have a lot of confidence in me. Give me a chance and you won't regret it.","contact":"haden.davis321@hotmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T02:02:03.873Z"}
