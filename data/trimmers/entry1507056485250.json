I returned to the country to do that also in California but the friends basically fell through for me and then I was hit with unexpected bills that I need to pay. I am available 24/7 and just want to trim and earn money. I have a car and can relocate anyplace that can provide me work. I can and will work 15 hours a day, seven days a week to make some money. I can pitch a tent or sleep in my car and pay all my own bills.","contact":"Please contact me at tsullivan881@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T18:48:05.250Z"}
