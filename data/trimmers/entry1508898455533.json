I am a strong Black femme who can endure being outside in all weather conditions, I am strong and I am a hard worker. I have the freedom of time and space to live where I work and/ or travel as well as I am an artist and therefore I am accustomed to a seasonal/gig work schedule. I respect the plant, and I will do my best to get the most of a farmer's crop as I know they worked hard all year sowing good into the herb. I really am interested in learning more about the plant, how it is grown, how to trim it and curate it, and identifying different types of the plant. Please provide me the opportunity to learn and work hard and give back to the Earth. I prefer to work the land and in natural elements to capitalism and buildings and I would like to really build a loyal relationship with a farm/farmer. Please give me a chance to get on the path I believe is for me. Best, Uhuru","contact":"hashtagsnatchpower@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-25T02:27:35.533Z"}
