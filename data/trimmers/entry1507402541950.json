They live in town and would not be on site needless to say. I have prior Military experience as well as Private Security work as well in the industry and out. I have allways trimmed all my own stuff and with yield of over 10 plus I could bring ready for market on wet trim in no more than 3 day's not even under pressure just working a a steady pace. I'm not sure as to how that stands up to industry standard but it seemed like a pretty good time. I have left the East coast, Jacksonville,FL  because of the industry violence. Brother against Brother and so on. I am excited to learn from the professionals and only offer hard work and open ears. Thanks. \r\nE.T.M","contact":"Ectylermerrick@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-07T18:55:41.950Z"}
