My name is Tyler! I'm a traveler living in a tent looking for an honest trimming job, I love hard physical labor. I would only require perhaps a little food and maybe some shelter if there weren't any wooded area for me to pitch up my tent, to get me by until I got paid IF I got the job. All I can offer is hard honest work and good vibes!","contact":"tyjefferies1992@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-17T23:59:24.943Z"}
