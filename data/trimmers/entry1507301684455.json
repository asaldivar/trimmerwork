I have applied for my OLCC license and I am waiting on my background check. I am an excellent employee/coworker because I have a great attitude and work ethic. I am yet to find a skill I can’t master so I’d love a chance to destroy that one pound minimum. I am actually a postpartum doula, professionally, but as an independent contractor I can allow time to enjoy other interests as well. I currently work overnights and would love a daytime job I could equally enjoy. I am hoping for 30-40 hours a week, and I have my own transportation. I would love a chance to work with you to create the best products you can.","contact":"Text: 971-713-1608","date":"2017-10-06T14:54:44.455Z"}
