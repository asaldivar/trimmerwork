I have also gained most of my credits in transferring to Cal Poly Pomona within the next year. Iâ€™ve built my college education around scientifically understanding and practicing horticulture techniques, I am also well versed in plant diseases, medium amendments, genetics (cross breeding), propagation and pruning techniques to name a few.
