In my time with the company I've went from trimming, to managing trimmers, then Ultimately moved to cultivation for the last 4 months. I can trim strain on or off the stem, wet, dry, tight trim or loose.  I'm a motivated self starter and team player.  My average depending on strain is 3-4 lbs per day. I'm available to start immediately. Thank you for your time.","contact":"lexmedz1987@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T15:03:49.768Z"}
