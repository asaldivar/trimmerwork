My current lease is up on Dec 1st and I am planning to move back to the general Portland area within the next 2 months. I am a very bubbly person with a huge personality, I have extensive knowledge in the cannabis industry and I really would like it to be my career. I have been personally growing for the past 2 years on a medium size scale I am very familiar with all strain types, and effects of strains. I have great customer service skills and I was also in the navy for a while so I am a very accountable and punctual person. My goal is to set up a job before I move so I can start working right when I get there! I am super determined to get into this ever growing cannabis industry and make it a lifestyle for myself. I just returned from a 4 month commercial fishing trip in Alaska, working 15 hours a day everyday, so I can vouch for myself when I say I am a hard worker, and you can always count on me! I know my product, I stay up to date on trends, and I can trim like a mad man!","contact":"garrettnapolitano@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-17T20:58:52.623Z"}
