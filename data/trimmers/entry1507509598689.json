I am quick and keen and a great independent worker as well as a good working with others. I left the hotel because I was held hostage at gunpoint and no longer felt safe. I am availible all the time. I do have a vehicle and can get virtually anywhere.","contact":"Dustfreaker@hotmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T00:39:58.688Z"}
