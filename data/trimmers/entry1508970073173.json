I am tired of living in a non-legal state and I want to move to somewhere else but the only problem is I need to find a job first. I am a very hard worker, I have a lot of experience in the food business, I’ve worked as a cook, dishwasher, host, server, and I always do what I’m asked to do and show up on time. I really would love to be able to work as a trimmer because I have a love for cannabis and I really just want to be happy and do something that I love to do and could be proud of as a worker. I know it sounds a bit odd that I live in Little Rock and I’m applying for this job but I promise you I am very serious about being hired and it’s something I’ve wanted to do for a very long time. If you hired me you I would make sure that you never regret that decision. I have something to prove and I am more than willing to prove that I can do everything you ask of me and more. Please consider hiring me for this position, I promise you’d be making a great choice.","contact":"geraines@ualr.edu","date":"2017-10-25T22:21:13.171Z","timestamp":1508970073}
