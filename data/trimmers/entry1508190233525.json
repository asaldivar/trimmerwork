I am in the process of buying a home in Sherwood and will be settling down with the wife in the area.  I very much enjoy working with plants and have been doing so professionally for the last several years and would like to find a good job that allows me to continue doing so.  I have been working with cannabis professionally and have found it amazingly enjoyable, so I was intrigued when I saw your posting.\r\n\r\nI have a degree in horticulture from OSU and have spent the last several years working at nurseries, greenhouses, and wineries.  I am highly adaptable and have a widely diverse experience both in plant fields and jobs in general.  I have managerial experience and have taught and supervised children both here and overseas.  I am reliable, honest, and hardworking (but who would not say those things?).  I am enthusiastic and love plants in general and find cannabis to be highly fascinating.  I have worked with cannabis professionally as a plant health specialist for Pruf Cultivar as an indoor grow and have grown myself outdoor.  I have unique knowledge and experience with mycorrhizae and try and stay updated with entomology in my field.\r\n\r\nI would like to work within 40 minutes of my home but I am available to work anytime (though I would like at least one day on the weekend to spent with the wife who works nights).  I know I may seem overqualified, but I have never been afraid to start from the bottom.  Feel free to contact me via 971-216-2138 or at kodamakami@yahoo.com.  Have a good one and I hope to hear from you soon.","contact":"kodamakami@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-16T21:43:53.525Z"}
