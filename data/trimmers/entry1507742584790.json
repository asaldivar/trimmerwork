I think I will salvage about an once and I have pictures of the onslaught.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have grown for many years and I have always done my owm trim work. I am highly adaptable, hard working, and very reliable. Not much exerience in a commericial environment, but, will make up for this with the ability to learn and get along well with fellow workers.\r\n\r\nI live in Ashland and prefer to work here locally. Able to work after I get my kids on the bus, Monday though Friday, after 8:00 am and I am available weekends after 2:00 pm. I plan on working Mt. Ashland when the snow comes in December, but, if this gig works out well you never know.\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your kind consideration,\r\n\r\nNed","contact":"Please contact me at nedsmith1642@yahoo.com or text/phone (775)203-8984","date":"2017-10-11T17:23:04.790Z"}
