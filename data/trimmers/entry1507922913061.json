My name is Tyler and I just arrived from Florida to Santa Cruz about a week ago to try and find a trim job for the season. I'm staying with a friend now in Santa Cruz but have a vehicle and would be willing to travel as far as Oregon for a job as long as I could live on site. I'm honest, hardworking, and driven to save as much as I can over the next couple months to fund my upcoming trip to New Zealand. If you're looking for an easy going, drama free guy who will put his headphones in and trim for 12 hours straight then I'm your guy!","contact":"tydavis87@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-13T19:28:33.060Z"}
