I have fiskars and a place to stay in Gold Hill, but no wheels so a place nearby would be best, or stay on site.  I can trim at least a pound a day or more depending on the strand. I do not have an OCLL card as of yet but will apply if necessary to start. I've done trim work for a friend off and on as needed and this is my 2nd season in southern Oregon.  I am focused, tidy, and like to do a good job. I am looking for 2 weeks full time or on-site trim work.  Thank you for your consideration.","contact":"deepee1111@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-30T02:36:58.061Z"}
