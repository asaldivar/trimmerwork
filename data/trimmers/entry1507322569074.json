My name is Ryan Markuson and I am very excited to hear about your job opening! A little about me, I was born in Portland and raised in Oregon City where I graduated in 2014. I am currently a term away from my transferâ€™s degree where I will then attend OSU online and complete my bachelor degree in horticulture. For the past year, Lotus Family Farms has been growing on my family's 4th generational 90 acre farm under the supervision of master grower Ilo Ferroggiaro. I have been his understudy for the last season and have managed 2,500 hundreds plants with Ilo and another grow assistant. The reason I am looking for work elsewhere is because your facility is much closer to where my classes are, and I take my education very seriously. I am used to hard work and have the back to keep up. I am a 6 ft. 7 in. male, and I have spent all my summers growing up as a farm hand on my family's farm, and am used to the farm work style. I have experience in mixing soil, transplanting, tea brewing, wet and dry feeding, foliar spraying, dead/big leafing, looking for pests and plant deficiency's, ppm/PH readings, and running irrigation lines. I have more experience growing than I do trimming, but I am a quick learner. I really hope to hear from you soon! Thank you for the consideration. Have a nice day!\r\nFeel free to call me as well at\r\n(503)-704-2104","contact":"markuson.ryan@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T20:42:49.074Z"}
