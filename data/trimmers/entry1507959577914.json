I've been trimming the last season in the area,  I'm learning fast and I can trim you a nice 2 pound a day to 3 if it's really good to trim. Looking for something right now and available till december. I got my tent and my tarp and I will be super happy to find a place to set it! Hope to find some great people out there to work with :)","contact":"7075990433","date":"2017-10-14T05:39:37.913Z"}
