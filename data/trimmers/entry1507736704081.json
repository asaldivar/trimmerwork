In the past I have also held roles such as watering, feeding, transplanting, grooming and building structures for the plants. As the harvest season comes to an end so does most of the support work...therefore I am currently seeking other companies who still need help. I am available all days and have my own transportation.","contact":"lovelifeme2@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-11T15:45:04.080Z"}
