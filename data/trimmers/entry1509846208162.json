We sold it as caring for my ailing mother (with whom I shared ownership of property) became impossible at home and she needed her share of proceeds to pay for a long term facility. \r\n\r\nWe are well versed in all aspects of marijuana growing from cloning to planting through packaging and sale. As former growers ourselves, we understand what goes into each plant and the importance of trimming with care. Ensuring that only necessary cuts are made for optimal visual and olfactory appeal as well health and quality of the plant is key to efficacy and waste management. Additionally, we just love the whole process of marijuana cultivation and miss it fiercely. We are exclusively seeking work at the same farm as we are a one vehicle family and we enjoy working with one another. \r\n\r\nWe grew our farm from 12 plants the first season to 48 plants the last season. Had we not sold, this year would have been the first to require additional help as our growth plan was for 72 plants. We did not work for anyone nor employ anyone, as such, professional references may pose a challenge. However, our knowledge and experience would easily be ascertained through the interview process. \r\n\r\nWe really just want to get back to what  we know and love and hope to find a farm we can invest our time and energy  in, gaining a vested interest in the life and peace giving medicine together.\r\n\r\nWe are available immediately, can work any shift, any number of hours, holidays and weekends.","contact":"Moandmattross@gmail.com","date":"2017-11-05T01:43:28.160Z"}
