Bend Oregon 97701\r\n541-668-0912 \r\n\r\n\r\nDear potential employers, \r\n\r\nWe are a professional trimming couple from Bend Oregon seeking Full time/Seasonal employment in Southern Oregon. We have over 5 years of experience and knowledge of the new laws, how to identify molds and rot and how to work fast, producing quality buds all at the same time. We recently spent 25 days on a recreational farm in Portland. Our average hours were 7:30am to 5:30pm, together trimming around 1,500 to 2,000 grams per day (Depending on the strain). \r\n\r\nWe are known for working well with others and making the best out of any situation. We’ve made hundreds of friends in the past 5 years and take great pride in what we do. We are both over 21 years old, have reliable transportation and have taken the OLCC Marijuana Handlers test. We will be able to start around November 1st, possibly sooner. We may need help finding a place, but eventually plan on buying an RV. Please call us if you need more information and have a great day!  \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nSydney & Cole  \r\n\r\nLicense Numbers:\r\n\r\nSydney Barnes\r\n7962916 \r\n\r\nCole Krewson\r\n7976880","contact":"Please contact us at 541-668-0912","date":"2017-10-10T18:50:46.215Z"}
