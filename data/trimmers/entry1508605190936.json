I am familiar with all parts of the process from growing to harvesting to drying to bucking to trimming and quality control. Depending on the quality of the product, I trim between 1 to 2 pounds a day. I am currently in grad school Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays and am looking to work any other days of the week in Los Angeles, or I can work starting at 3pm on the aforementioned days. Thanks for your consideration and I hope to speak with you soon.","contact":"jmeiradovalle@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-21T16:59:50.936Z"}
