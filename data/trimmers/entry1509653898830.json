I do have previous experience in the cannabis industry and have been involved in it since i was a teenager, im 30 now. I just passed my test through the olcc, have my ommp card and my own reliable transportation so that is not an issue. Im a self motivated hard woker and working in the cannabis industry is my passion. I also have reliable references available upon request, previous work experience in both the garden and in dispensary.\r\nMy schedule is typically open so just let me know which timeframes you guys are trying to fill for the position. accommodations that i could only really think of that i may need help with is either gas money or making sure i have a steady flow of income so i can make sure my bills are paid on time. I do have a brand new car i am making payments on insurance, rent etc that has to be paid each month. \r\n Please get back to me as soon as you get the chance!\r\n\r\n Canna-blessings\r\nAdam D'Hondt","contact":"mrbonez_06@yahoo.com or 971-226-9882","date":"2017-11-02T20:18:18.829Z"}
