I am willing to travel, but just need a floor to sleep on or a place to pitch a tent. I can bring my own food, and on past jobs have worked partially as the group chef. I am happy to help with harvest if needed as well. \r\n\r\nArielle (831) 325-6360","contact":"Laurawrongphoto@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-27T07:14:59.057Z"}
