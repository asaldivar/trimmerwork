I believe my work ethic and previous experience make me an ideal candidate for this job! While I would consider myself an entry level trimmer in the field, I have helped trim both indoor and outdoor harvests for multiple friends. I am hardworking and efficient, but also have an open mind and am quick to learn new skills and techniques. I work well in multiple environments and both independently as well as on a team. I am available for work starting as soon as possible up until mid December. I am ideally looking for a place that offers food and area to camp, but am open to options depending on location. \r\nThanks so much for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you!","contact":"Kmorgan1625@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-23T10:45:23.233Z"}
