I work very well with others after a year at a movie theater. I'm used to being on a crew, and have experience with adapting to orders. I was the stock manager at See's Candy and those had to be wrapped this way, and placed this way so I'm good at following the specific methods that pertain to each item. I can start right away and do have a positive history with marijuana. I'm not applying to Starbucks if I don't love coffee right. 310-463-8567 or gabeaquick@gmail.com","contact":"310-463-8567 or gabeaquick@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-04T05:03:59.791Z"}
