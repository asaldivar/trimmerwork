My passion for the plant comes from delivering the ultimate medicine to those in need, and the feeling of purpose that comes from bringing people the blessing of cannabis' effects. I have offered a helping hand in half a dozen grows and helped trim over a dozen harvests of both indoor and outdoor.","contact":"Please contact me at sshepard@willamette.edu","date":"2017-10-05T22:15:32.404Z"}
