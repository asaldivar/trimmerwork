I have always been a very positive person with a great work ethic.  I'd absolutely love to work with my hands and be proud of the quality of my work trimming.  I understand I have no experience trimming, but I am college educated, a fast learner, and have references of my previous work experience available.\r\n\r\nI am looking for full-time work, but very open to hear about seasonal and part-time positions.
