I can trim about 2 and 1/2 pounds of some dense outdoor. I’m moving from Maine in hopes of a fresh start and only have enough cash for a bus ticket and food along the way. I’d just need a place to crash for a week or two until I get an apartment when I get the cash to do so. My girlfriend is pregnant so I’m trying to go out to California to find opportunities. Im available as long as you need me to be.","contact":"dcunningham4774@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-25T01:48:45.325Z"}
