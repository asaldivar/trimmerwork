As such, I have been interested in working my way into the marijuana industry and feel this opportunity would bring you benefit from my talents and me a learning experience and potential career. I currently do not hold my license, but am in the process of working towards obtaining it. For the past 15 years I have been primarily a stay at home mother, working part time through the years delivering the newspaper and running in home childcare. Now that my children are older, require less of my attention, I would like to be part of the movement bringing marijuana to be a larger part of our culture, our community. What you will get by hiring me is a detailed, dependable, fast learning and responsibly hard worker and has a passion for this industry.","contact":"jillsbutterfly@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-24T01:37:43.050Z"}
