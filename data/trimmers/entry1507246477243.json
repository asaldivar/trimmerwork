I would need Mondays off and though it would be easiest to secure a ride to work after 1pm every day if that couldn't be accommodated I wouldn't accept the position (if it was offered) if I felt I couldn't be reliably able to get to work at the appointed time . It all depends on Time and location.","contact":"Justinmalotdriscoll@outlook.com","date":"2017-10-05T23:34:37.243Z"}
