I have been trimming for several years seasonally and recently moved full time and looking for more opportunities. If needing to travel I prefer indoor accommodations but will camp if the price is right. I can typically average 1.5 pounds a day depending on the hours maybe more. If there is full time work I prefer that and am open to advancement or a lead position within a company. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks.","contact":"info@tenthdegree.org","date":"2017-10-06T19:26:36.888Z"}
