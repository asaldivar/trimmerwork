I would really like to continue trimming full time after the outdoor season is over and would love any leads on place to rent or a trailer to buy. I can trim just over two pounds of outdoor per day and love the cannabis community. Also an avid skateboarder and guitar player.","contact":"cknaack96@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T23:32:52.900Z"}
