We work hard, and efficiently. \r\nWe have a camper built out in our Tacoma, with two small well behaved dogs. Simply need a campground or place to park near by. We are very self-sufficient. Looking forward to improving in a new trade.","contact":"Danyellemaria333@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T23:43:20.972Z"}
