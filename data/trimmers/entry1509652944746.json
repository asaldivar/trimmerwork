Having trimmed over 200 pounds a year for three consecutive years equipped me with exceptional skill and the ability o produce professional, top-quality results. A patient, strong work ethic, amenable personality and work flexibility have helped me to excel as a trimmer, chop queen and grower. Although my expertise extends beyond, trimming is what I most enjoy. I have been housed on-site, have come prepared with my own accomodations (tent/camper), and can also provide trimming at an alternate facility. Accustomed to long periods of travel.","contact":"chopqueencamielle@gmail.com","date":"2017-11-02T20:02:24.746Z"}
