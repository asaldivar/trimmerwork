I am able to trim 600 grams in 8 hours. Experience with blue dream, strawberry banana, gorilla glue, headband etc. Open minded in technique, mostly what suits the particular flowers. I have an eye for impurities, ensuring quick removal and optimum product for client. I also keep personal hygiene and cleanless of my environment in mind. Open availability. Preferably full-time.
