I usually camp out in my truck onsite, but depending on where the job is, I may have a place to stay. I can buy and make all of my own meals. My boyfriend is also a trimmer and has experience as well. He is a lampworker and makes functional pieces, so he has a good understanding of many strains and functions. We would both need to come together. I have passed my OLCC permit test and can provide a copy upon request.","contact":"lpbeutler@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T08:41:29.617Z"}
