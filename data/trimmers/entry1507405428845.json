I have 8 years experience.... Can complete 3-5 units a day depending on strain... All quality of course.  I am 100% honest...  Very focused in work,  don't spend a lot of time hanging out although I love to meet new people,  don't care about days off,  just ask for a respectful  work environment  (no yelling or condescending workers)...  I have no addictions and conduct myself in a professional manner.  I am always positive and will trim smalls or any kind of medicine.   I show up w my own tools and am self sufficient  as far as food and camping etc...  Thanks for considering  me.","contact":"#530-955-1769","date":"2017-10-07T19:43:48.844Z"}
