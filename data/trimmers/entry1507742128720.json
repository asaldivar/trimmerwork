I also possess an artistic eye.  I require onsite accommodations (tent space OK), meals included or nearby availability of food if possible. I will be flying out, so I do not have transportation. I am looking to start full-time ASAP October-December, as the fellowship opportunity I am pursuing does not begin until January. I have applied for my OLCC but have not received it yet. Due to the complexities of the laws regarding professional licensing, I have declined to provide references because I want to keep this work private from my professional network.","contact":"colleen_fogg@my.uri.edu","date":"2017-10-11T17:15:28.720Z"}
