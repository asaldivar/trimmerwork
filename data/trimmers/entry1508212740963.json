I loved my job and the environment was amazing but due to the fact of going back to school I no longer had time to manage the shop and there weren't many positions of just regular budtending so I stopped working there. I think I would be great for this job due to the fact that I am well versed on my rules and I already have my OLCC card. Also I am a very enthusiastic and energetic person who does not need trimming well because I have experience. attached to this letter ive included a resume and a recommendation letter from my past employer. If you think I may be suited for this job you can reach me at (503)576-1497.","contact":"jessicasingh014@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-17T03:59:00.963Z"}
