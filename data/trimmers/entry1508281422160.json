My two close friends and I are looking for trim work in Humboldt County. We are currently located in Eureka and have our own shelter, transportation, kitchen, and food supply. \r\n    \r\n    I personally have no experience in trim work rather than trimming my own supply, but I do have the proper supplies to work! I am available to work anytime through October and November.","contact":"9542001366","date":"2017-10-17T23:03:42.160Z"}
