I've been using cannabis daily for a little over a year, and I'm they type of person that appreciates deep knowledge regarding my work and life-syle.  Knocking out a couple with one stone so to speak is what this job would inherently do for me.  And I hope to prove in a paragraph why I'm a worthy interview in a pool of people also enthusiastic to work in the industry.\r\n\r\nI'm naturally good with my hands, because I've been a musician for twenty years(guitar mostly).  Im also good with chop-sticks.  I only need part time income because I make money in various ways myself.  I'd love to add my talents to this team, it sounds like an ideal marriage of talents and a mutual benefit.  \r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nPat Perkins","contact":"pperkins@alumni.berklee.edu","date":"2017-10-13T05:14:34.769Z"}
