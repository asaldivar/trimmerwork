My name is DeJanae Evins. I have over a decade of experience taking on new roles and completely exceeded expectations. I've worked in almost every industry from tech to entertainment. I'm currently looking to learn as much as possible about growing and cultivating marijuana. Trimming seems like a good place to start. I'm currently working on producing a cannabis-inspired YouTube channel and would love to learn more about the industry, literally from the ground up. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for your consideration. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDeJanae Evins","contact":"dejanae.evins@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-25T02:29:24.088Z"}
