I am willing to work for minimal or entry-level wages. I used to own my own landscaping company. I did design work, installation, procurement and maintenance of landscaping materials and plants. My company did maintenance of everything except lawn mowing. I installed sprinkler systems and did light construction. Additionally I have been a teacher of special ed for 36 years. I am retired now and looking for supplemental income. I know a lot about plants. I have grown my own cannabis plants in the past but have limited experience with that specific type of horticulture. I learned very quickly. I am reliable and a hard worker. I arrive to work on time and I stay focused in my duties while at work.  I am responsible  and  will do a great job in any field I endeavor. I'll be happy to supply a resume on request as well as references. I thank you for your consideration. </p><p><br></p><p>Pattie Harris </p><p>619-581-9870</p><p><br></p>","certification":"true","references":"true","contact":"6195819870","date":"2017-12-02T23:02:47.042Z"}
