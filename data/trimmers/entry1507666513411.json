I work with a group of friends where we do cut down of plants and hanging them to dry until they are ready for us to trim. I would prefer to stay within the Los Angeles area for work but if needed outside then I would like to be accommodated with a place to stay. During work all I would need provided for me is lunch. I can put it in an eight hour work day with no problem and produce a couple of pounds.","contact":"818 429 5005","date":"2017-10-10T20:15:13.410Z"}
