Ive been getting paid hourly and sometimes by the gram. I'm very comfortable with leading a team, I'm confident in my work style and I'm also very flexible with my schedule. I live in Detroit Michigan as a medical marijuana patient, I'm looking to relocate so coming somewhere that will honor my card is very comforting.","contact":"My email address @ lorealgonzalez23@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-05T00:54:16.815Z"}
