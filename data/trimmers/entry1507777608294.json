Took my olcc test. I can werk close to McMinnville. If it's kinda farther I would need a place to crash. But I AM hell of a lot of fun. I AM driven by my Midwest werk ethic. I want to find a DOPE tribe to GROW with. And live, laugh, and love while we werk. Very solid. I got a HELL of a resume.I could knock out two units a day easy.","contact":"219-238-4205","date":"2017-10-12T03:06:48.294Z"}
