Iâ€™ve grown since in my teens. I have always had a green thump and a passion for naturally grown plants. I find my peace in the dirt. I love every part of the process from cloning to flowering. I'm motivated to provide the best quality product out there.  When you are passionate and believe in this beautiful, healing plant there's no reason to to be able to do what I love.\r\nThank you for taking the time to consider having me in your business.","contact":"Frankvshields@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T00:19:21.972Z"}
