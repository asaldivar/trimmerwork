My experience has mostly been in Oregon on medical outdoor grows. The sizes of the medical grows varied from 24 to 99 plants. In March of 2017 I started my Rec/OLCC career. I have experience in all aspects of growing and processing. Outdoor, Indoor, and Light Deprivation Greenhouses. I have participated in high volume harvests and grows up to 500 lbs per harvest. I have helped manage crews as well. As far as trimming goes, depending on the buds I can usually trim a finished sell able lb in 4-8 hours. Sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how tight the trim required is and how chunky the buds are. I have trained new trimmers and can manage a trim scene. I have extensive experience in wet or dry trim. I have ran trim machines as well. I feel like I am a fully qualified cannabis Grower and processing bud getting ready for sale. \r\n\r\nI am currently employed at a Licenced Recreational Farm in Southern Oregon and can provide references if interested. \r\n\r\nI am looking to move to the Portland Area by mid November/Early December. I have a temporary housing available while I transition to my own home or apartment. The main reason I am moving to Portland is to support my Daughter's medical needs. She was born very prematurely, and the Medical resources are much higher quality up in Portland. If there are any leads on my own housing I am open to exploring my options and would like to settle into my own spot ASAP.","contact":"jpsilver1332@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-12T06:13:39.918Z"}
