Iâ€™m looking for some part time work. Although I am entry level, I have a lot of friends from New York that come out to California to trim, so I have a pretty good idea of the work/effort that is expected for this job.  I just recently got out of the marine corps which is why I never got into it myself, but now that I am out I am looking to get my feet wet and hands dirty. I am a hard worker and I definitely believe that I am fit for this job.","contact":"Jaymarrmusic@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-25T23:25:14.518Z","timestamp":1508973914}
