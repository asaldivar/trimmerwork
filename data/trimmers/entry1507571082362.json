It has been probably half a year since Iv'e last trimmed cannabis but I feel like the muscle memory comes back to me pretty quickly whenever I pick it back up.  I encourage and take criticism well.  I'm a College of the Redwoods student transfering to HSU next fall to get a bachelors in Communications.  I am looking for part-time work, however, all of my classes except for 1 are online.  So the only time I wouldn't be able to work is mondays and wednesdays from 10 30am until 1pm.","contact":"ertman.ryan51@gmail.com or 707-601-8808","date":"2017-10-09T17:44:42.362Z"}
