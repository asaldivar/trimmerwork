I've trimmed in Garberville for a year and a half . I can do 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (or more depending on strain) a day . I can also help with leafing and / or any farm related work . Don't mind working long hours . I am available from November 7th through January . I travel with my husband we have a car and we can camp if necessary. The only thing We need is a place to put our food , use the bathroom and if possible a place to sleep but as I said , we can camp . We are reliable , hard working , young entrepreneurs looking to grow in the cannabis industry . \r\nOnce again Thanks for your time and I look forward for a prompt response .","contact":"haidygos@gmail.con","date":"2017-10-18T01:55:46.226Z"}
