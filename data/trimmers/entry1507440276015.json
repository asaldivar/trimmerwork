I have traveled to California in order to work as much as I can for the season and earn money to bring back with me to Mexico. I haven't trimmed before, but I am a focused, responsible person and I am eager to learn. I am honest and clean, I don't smoke or drink heavily, and my only goal is to trim as much as I can for a fair rate, hourly or per pound. I need a place to pitch a tent and I would be fine with either (vegetarian) food provided or a basic cooking space to prepare my own meals. I am available from now until around mid-November.","contact":"Please contact me at 612-810-6520","date":"2017-10-08T05:24:36.014Z"}
