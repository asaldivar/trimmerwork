Years of steady indoor wet trimming out of Eugene and various outdoor situations around the triangle.  I am available now, after the 9th of October is better(dog appointment).  Would like to camp onsite with my dog, she can be kenneled though if its a hassle.  \r\n\r\nMeals are very much appreciated but can provide all my own everything as long as a water source is close to camp.  Shower is very much preferred, especially when cold. Have gear and like using pure grain alcohol/olive oil as a scissor cleaner but will use rubbing alcohol if preferred. \r\n\r\nStrive to unite those around me and keep it positive under all circumstances.  Can be productive talking but prefer to just zone into my music and get \"green machine\" mode going. Downside is I picked up lyme working in Humboldt in 2014, not stoked on tick heavy environments but not deterred by that either.  Most days consistent and bulletproof, but then there's just those days....As a result I'm single and a loner musician type who likes to play guitar when possible(rock, reggae, world music). Having time off is needed preferably 2 days(maybe more) a week but that's negotiable if accommodations facilitate the productivity. Good luck and all the best.. \r\n\r\nP.S. I passed the permit test in the spring but never paid for it. Willing to get the permit if necessary just haven't really had the reason to yet.","contact":"email: apatters9@gmail.com     phone: 541-261-0426","date":"2017-10-06T03:52:44.159Z"}
