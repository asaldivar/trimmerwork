I am almost 40 years old, been a cannabis user since the age of 16, so know a little something about varieties and such. I am eager to be in touch with plants. I am not as much of a user at this point, as I am interested in connection to the Earth and using plants as medicines. I see trimming as a meditative opportunity with the possibility to help others along the way.\r\n\r\nI am open to working anywhere in the West as I am currently taking a year off from my work as an educator. I am currently in California and a native of Colorado. I am willing to work hard for a short period of time in this field.\r\n\r\nIf housing is available, that would be awesome as I am currently traveling through the world. I am also self-sufficient and can plan on finding a place to stay nearby if there is no other options.  I am open to living in shared spaces, communal  or co-living/working style. \r\n\r\nI consider myself a Nomadic Renaissance Woman and am excited to experience different ways of life to learn, write, and dance about them. I have spent a good portion of this year traveling in Spain and France, honing in on my personal practices in meditation, movement, and light working. It would be an honor to work with the green and bring light to others through this work. \r\n\r\nPlease reach out to me. I would prefer to work anytime after October 29 until needed. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading this!","contact":"aprilcharmaine@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-22T02:58:33.587Z"}
