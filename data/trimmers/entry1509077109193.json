I've decided to complete my masters but am looking for a full time job that will help supplement my income during school. My hours are more than flexible and am able to also provide any marketing and advertising experience in order to help promote the cannabis industry in the approaching months once it is legalized at a recreational level in California. I hope that some day the federal government will get its act together and eventually make this accessible to everyone.","contact":"da695160@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-27T04:05:09.192Z"}
