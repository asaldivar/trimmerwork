I have hard work ethic, I am a quick learner and am able to adapt to any changes. I have trimmed for only a few days, so I have very little experience but I am eager to learn more about the cannabis industry and I think this would be a great opportunity to do so. I look forward to hear from you. Thank you.","contact":"Please contact me at 541-531-1261","date":"2017-10-09T05:07:12.792Z"}
