Ever since I was young, I've been trying to get my hands on the newest stuff. I started trimming about 6 years ago. I always had friends that grow and they always needed help trimming. I have trimmed ounces at a time. It has been one of my hobbies my whole life and always will be. Thank you very much for your consideration.","contact":"emilynaso@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-07T01:35:25.414Z"}
