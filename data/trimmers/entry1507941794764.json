My husband and I have multiple farmers that request us to do their trimming throughout the year. I've experience in trimming many different strands and usually can trim half pound during a part time shift.  We have noticed a decline in trimming needs with smaller farmers, we are looking to help elsewhere, although we will continue helping our regulars too.","contact":"Tmarier69@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-14T00:43:14.763Z"}
