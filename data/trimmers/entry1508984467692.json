I am writing to inquire about your trimmer position.  I am relatively new to the industry but am very passionate about it.  I'm just finishing up my first grow/harvest.  I have also learned how to clone successfully too.  My equipment I have right now has a 100% success rate for my clones. I stay at home so my schedule is pretty flexible.   I am an RN by trade but since I had my son I have stayed at home and don't really have an interest to go back into nursing right now.   I live just outside of Boring, near Dodge Park. I would be available 2-3 full days per week while my son is in school.  I have applied for the permit, passed the test, etc.  Can you tell me a little about the position and what a day might look like?  Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you. Look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nCasey\r\n\r\nText 971-221-9582 or this email","contact":"caseyjgoff@gmail.com or text me at 971-221-9582","date":"2017-10-26T02:21:07.691Z","timestamp":1508984467}
