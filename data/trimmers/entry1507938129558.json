It has been quite the change for me, since I was the Store Manager to the Journeys Shoe Store in the Valley River Center of Eugene, Oregon. I am a hard worker and have always moved up in positions with everywhere I have worked. I pick up information easy and have the brain of a sponge. Passion is carried on my shoulder. If you pick me, you wonâ€™t be disappointed.","contact":"V.mcgeehon@icloud.com","date":"2017-10-13T23:42:09.557Z"}
