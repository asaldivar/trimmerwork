Most of my professional experience is in the veterinary world which speaks to my ability to work well in a fast paced, high stakes environment and quickly adapt to any situation at hand. I do believe I am worth training as I am a very reliable, responsible, flexible, and organized worker.","contact":"Please contact me at fdobrina@outlook.com","date":"2017-10-05T21:53:59.285Z"}
