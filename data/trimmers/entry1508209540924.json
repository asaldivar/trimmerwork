I am originally from California and grew my share there prior to legalization and had a pretty good crop out here last year. I can trim close to 2 lbs of outdoor a day maybe more depending on the environment. I do not need a place to live. I will be coming home at night but do need meals provided during shifts. I would prefer to be paid by the pound rather than hourly but all is negotiable.","contact":"541-499-9253","date":"2017-10-17T03:05:40.924Z"}
