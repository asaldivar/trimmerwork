About a year or 2. Been wanting to get my foot in the door in the cannabis industry. I used to run a grow operation with a friend of mine that went extremely well. Im currently self employed doing contract work for a delivery company and I deal on the side. Been wanting to find a way to do what I’m doing in a much more efficient and productive way. Figure this job could help point me in the right direction while doing something I enjoy.","contact":"Peterlovincey@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T13:32:29.620Z"}
