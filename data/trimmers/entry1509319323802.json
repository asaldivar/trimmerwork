I am now in California, looking to work in a nice and chill atmosphere. While my experience with trimming is limited, I am hardworking and a quick and avid learner, who knows when to persevere. I'm used to working in a fast paced environment and am available 24/7. A place to pitch a tent would be ample for me.    \r\n\r\nAll the best, \r\n\r\nOscar","contact":"oplang22@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-29T23:22:03.801Z"}
