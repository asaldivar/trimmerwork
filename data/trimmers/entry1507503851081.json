I passed the OLCC test for marijuana handlers and can provide my email confirmation for permit application upon request. I am extremely hard working and reliable and will work as many hours as needed for the season. I have experience working in the field on cold wet days, standing for long hours over a trim pro and sitting for days on end trimming by hand. These tasks never bother me, I never complain and I work well with others. I can't wait to get started with a new team this year!","contact":"katiejanetteburke@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-08T23:04:11.080Z"}
