I live in the city and don't need a place to pitch a tent. Meals would be awesome but not necessary as I believe to be working within the same vicinity as my city. I'm a well organized individual that values his time thru his work. I can trim about a pound of hydro in about 6 hours. Wet and dry, thoroughly. Thank you for your time.","contact":"Best place to contact would be thehighvilla@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T03:33:22.895Z"}
