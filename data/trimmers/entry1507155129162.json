I'm incredibly interested in the opportunity to be a cannabis trimmer. Although I have no prior experience in cannabis trimming, I am currently working as a farming intern and have experience working long hours, working outside and working with others; as well as a degree in Geology from Northern Arizona University. I have a passion for marijuana that I would love to eventually develop into a career. \r\nI would need housing accommodations with a cannabis trimming position, but I do have my own vehicle, valid drivers license and a marijuana workers permit. I would like a position that starts ASAP and ends around the holidays, but I am very flexible on my time frame. \r\nPlease email me if you have any positions available. I'm confident I would make an excellent addition to your team.","contact":"Please contact me at sjs393@nau.edu or call me at 623-606-0545","date":"2017-10-04T22:12:09.162Z"}
