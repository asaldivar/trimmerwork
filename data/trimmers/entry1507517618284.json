I can trim roughly a pound of outdoor a day. I have experience with bucking down plants to trim, as well as with fine trimming. I am a college student so I am not available for work Monday-Thursday, but I can work all day Friday through Sunday. I am a hard and honest worker, with a high appreciation for the work I'm doing. I look forward to hearing back from you!","contact":"You can contact me by email at jacob.w.woodford@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-09T02:53:38.283Z"}
