I started off trimming at a dispensary in downtown LA then migrated to a couple of other shops. Eventually I migrated up north to work on a couple cannabis farms where i developed skills such as harvesting, transplanting, growing, maintaining and further improved my trimming. Depending on quality and demands, I can trim 2-3 pounds within a days work. I can also provide other services such as mold, pest and plague detecting. Looking for housing and  if not possible I'm willing to camp.","contact":"jbarcenas1991@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-30T21:44:26.009Z"}
