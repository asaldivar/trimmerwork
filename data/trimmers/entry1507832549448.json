I know all the ins and outs of bucking, trimmin, and curing. I worked on a small six light grow in 2011. That was my first experience in \"the business\". Spent 8 months in Oregon in 2016 and all I did was work on farms. From slicing new clones to finished product would be where I would be useful. My quickest pound I trimmed was a pound of bluedreams in 6 hours.","contact":"Nibholas@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-12T18:22:29.448Z"}
