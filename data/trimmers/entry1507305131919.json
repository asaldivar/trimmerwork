I was top trimmer on the farm I worked at last year (trimmed the most).  I ran a harvesting crew for a first time farmer who didn't know how to harvest and process his own crop (he was from Miami).  I have experience through all phases of growing and just finished managing an indoor medical grow in Colorado.  I am really fast big leafing on a trim pro.  I have a place near Ashland to stay, but I would be willing to camp by the job site if that would be more convenient and sounds good to you.  I am looking to work as much as possible through this year's harvest, trim season, and into winter if there is still work available.  I would be available to start 3/4 days after hire as I'm currently out of town.  I am also hardworking, honest, easy to get along with, and sober.  Cheers!","contact":"donteatscissors@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-06T15:52:11.918Z"}
