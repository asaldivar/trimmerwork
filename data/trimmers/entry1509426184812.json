I have a passion for the plant’s many benefits and uses. I’ve successfully grown my own medical marijuana for the past two years. During this time I’ve learned a lot of techniques and strategies from various websites for successfully growing cannabis outdoors. I have experience in wet trimming and dry trimming. I can work up to 30 hours a week and potentially more if more work needs to be done.
