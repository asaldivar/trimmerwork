I trim 1-2 pounds a day depending on the quality of the product. I am fast, focused and hardworking. My goal is to make as much money as possible during this trim season. I need a place to pitch my tent, and if some meals are included, that would be great too.","contact":"llubarov@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-16T17:08:37.179Z"}
