We've been on the road for months making a film, came home to California to trim! I and my (non romantic) partner are available next 6-8 weeks. A place to crash or to pitch a tent would be nice, as well.\r\n\r\nI am also an accomplished gourmet chef, specializing in French Proven√ßal and Italian peasant food, managing my own catering company in San Francisco for the previous 3 years. I have been trimming during harvest in NorCal and OR for the previous 5 years and am permitted to work in OR, as well as having a food handlers license for both OR and CA. \r\n\r\nWe are friendly chill professional dudes who are working to further our film goals and not merely just \"to make it to next season\". \r\n\r\nCheck us out, and thanks for reading this,\r\nW","contact":"Please contact me at hotgaymonkeysex@hotmail.com","date":"2017-10-06T00:43:31.350Z"}
