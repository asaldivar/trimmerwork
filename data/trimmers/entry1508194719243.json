I am old school with scissors and have wanted to try the new electric ones. I have never timed or weighed what I trim. I am a hard worker, fast learner and I don't smoke cigs or marijuana willing to take a drug test and criminal background check.. I have enjoyed starting them from seed and watching them turn into this amazing plant that can help with the pain that my husband deals with daily. I am available during the day 5am- 6pm. Would love full time but would accept anything.","contact":"unluckys36@aol.com","date":"2017-10-16T22:58:39.242Z"}
