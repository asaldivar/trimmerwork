Right now I am looking for full-time work, and just relocated to Portland from Phoenix. I am looking for an easy going environment, with a family-like team. Ideally, I would love to grow within a company. I am quick learner and can easily adapt to new surroundings. In the past I did administrative work, and then switched to education, as an assistant teacher. I have known a few people who have been in this line of work, and enjoyed it. I am very interested in learning the business. Ideally I would love to find a location in NE Portland but am flexible.","contact":"Please contact me at ashleynicholewright@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T21:20:29.776Z"}
