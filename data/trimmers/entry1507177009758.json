I enjoy the trade and love the plant, I enjoy seeing the different types of strains and seeing the medical benefits the plant produces. Over the years I have became very efficient and fast at trimming, normally can easily do a pound of freshly cut material in three hours.","contact":"jeddsmalley1593@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-05T04:16:49.758Z"}
