I can trim around 2 pounds of outdoor a day depending on quality, sometimes more, sometimes less. I have a car that I comfortably sleep in and can feed myself if need be or throw money into a pot so we can cook together. Im very easy going, a quick learner and take direction very well. Im a 26 year old male. Hope to hear from you guys, I'm sure you have tons of applicants. Take care!","contact":"Please email me at,   caseyjhones@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-08T20:54:46.752Z"}
