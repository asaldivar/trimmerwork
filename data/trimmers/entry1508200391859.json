I am a mature, reliable, and hardworking professional looking to work hard and make some money. I’m currently in Riverside, CA and can travel up North immediately. I have my own transportation, no criminal record, no drama either. I’m down to earth, do not use drugs expect the occasional Mary Jane cigarette. I don’t overindulge! I have a lot of energy and if considered, I’d work long hours and stay focused! Like I said, I’m looking to make some serious money! I’m also easy going, and do not engage in petty drama. That comes with age! (I’m 41 and I look much younger than that!) Anything else you’d like to know, please ask. I’m a quick study and eager to learn!! Thanks again and I hope to hear from you. :-)","contact":"Elizabeth.a.lauro@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-17T00:33:11.858Z"}
