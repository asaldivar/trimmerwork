I am motivated to work and look forward to spending more of my time around cannabis. I can provide my own accommodation but a place to dwell would be ideal. I don't mind camping out and am able to help on other gardening projects, animal care, cooking and more.","contact":"juliemoriel@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-07T12:53:35.885Z"}
