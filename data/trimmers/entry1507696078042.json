I don't have much experience trimming but I have a strong eye for detail and good familiarity with a variety of strains. I've been in the wilderness for the last six months so I'm good with long, repetitive work and getting along with the group even at the end of the day. I've also worked in a few industries that require efficient use of time and quick work. I would need a place to stay or camp but am ready to work immediately. \r\nThanks,\r\nTim","contact":"You can email me at timnwoody@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-11T04:27:58.042Z"}
