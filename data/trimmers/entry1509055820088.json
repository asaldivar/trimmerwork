I relocated to Los Angeles one year ago for my job, I am a sous chef working in Santa Monica right now but long time aspirer to the cannabis industry and eager to begin getting my foot in the door. Long term goal is a full transition into the industry but to start I am look for a part time or seasonal role to help. I do work full time but I can try to be flexible. Atleast two days a weeks on my days off. I am also available for any graveyard shifts if that interest you I'll put some hours in while everyone else sleeps.  If an opportunity can present itself to transition from my current position and I am able to provide for myself then I am extremely open to consider! I am tremendously trainable and I soak information in with a disciplined work ethic.  Availble as soon as I'm needed!","contact":"Santiago.Aristizabal53@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-26T22:10:20.087Z"}
