For my personal use, I have cultivated cannabis in soil and via hydroponics. I have grown enough to become fascinated by the diversity and variety of scents of cannabis. \r\n\r\nI’m responsible and hold a strong work ethic when it comes to performing tasks. Although I have no “formal professional experience\" working for a cannabis industry employer, I do feel I possess definite skills required for a variety of positions.\r\n\r\nI worked numerous years in the general landscape industry - where I gained valuable experience around plants and developed a strong work ethic. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.","contact":"neilkenes@gmail.com  323-424-9442","date":"2017-10-03T23:21:42.014Z"}
