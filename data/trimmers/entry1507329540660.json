I have many years running my own MMJ Collective in WA State, and am an experienced grower, processor, trimmer and manager of crews. I have a Master's degree and am bilingual in Spanish. I am also very quick at data entry, suoberb writer, and as an outreach spokesperson for marijuana.  I would like full time but would seasonally as well to start. I am hard working, diligent, and dedicated worker.\r\n\r\nI have moved back to this area(Humboldt County) as I have family here locally and was raised here and learned how to grow from Legacy Growers more than 30 years. ago.\r\n\r\nIf you hire me you not be disappointed. \r\n\r\nLook forward to hearing back from prospective employers who want a seasoned, hard working employee like no other.\r\n\r\nBless, \r\nAlicia Balas","contact":"360-281-7617","date":"2017-10-06T22:39:00.660Z"}
