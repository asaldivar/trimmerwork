Recently I've been growing for a company that has a 5000sqft barn and a outdoor green house 150sqft by 50sqft in rural Oregon city. My job was to do most the growing, harvesting and trimming since the company only had a couple employees I did everything from cloning to the processing. The company is having money issues and possibly is going out of business so I got laid off. I spent a lot of time with this company. We started in a garage doing medical and moved forward from there. I have an Olcc marijuana permit I just need to pay it. \r\nFeel free to call if you have any questions.","contact":"Mcmikeeeooo@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T18:30:55.376Z"}
