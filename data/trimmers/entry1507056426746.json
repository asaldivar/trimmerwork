I have down a full season in humboldt county in the garberville area working in several farms ranging from small and large scale. I have done another season in mendocino county and can do anywhere from 1 1/2 - 2 pounds a day depending on the quality of the bud and i can accomodate any growers preference of trim whether that be a tighter trim or a more leafy looking bud. I have also worked at shops in LA county ( Southern California Collective and Foothill Wellness Collective). I have a car for reliable on time transportation and am willing to travel north for work I have a tent i can set up anywhere if we're on a remote area on a mountain. I can start work immediately.","contact":"gizmocles@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-03T18:47:06.746Z"}
