From cutting down whole plants, trimming fan leafs, trimming wet bud, shucking nugs off of branches and trimming dry bud. I understand the whole scope of cultivating, drying, packaging, and selling flower although this job only focuses on trimming.\r\n\r\nI have my Marijuana workers permit, and I am available to start tomorrow!\r\nI have reliable transportation and can trim 20 oz's in 8 hours if the bud is right. I personally own 5 sets of trimming scissors so i can bring one with me if needed.","contact":"mayfieldcolin@gmail.com 9719986991","date":"2017-10-03T22:38:26.367Z"}
