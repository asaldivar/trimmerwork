Marijuana I know is a safe and non addictive alternative , that I could in good conscience help produce and sell.  It can help  with difficult times, as I discovered after getting out of the army in the Viet Nam era, and it helped me recover from stress, and I became a professor for ten years before retiring.  For these and other reasons I would appreciate the chance to remain active and productive in a burgeoning industry.   Thank you for your consideration.
