We are both looking for immediate employment. We have no trimming experience but have handled countless pounds of marijuana. We are cannabis enthusiasts and extremely hard workers.\r\n    The ideal scenario for us would be to park our RV on the property and work our asses off so we can get back on our feet. We currently do not have a vehicle other than our 30 ft RV so we are limited in our transportation abilities until we save up some money and buy a car. We're the perfect candidates for the job and can't wait to increase your productivity.","contact":"rtjacobs23@gmail.com","date":"2017-10-12T22:06:38.896Z"}
