Had been an Organic farmer growing fruit, nuts, and many vegetables with my family in Texas and CA. Got my CA recommendations 7 years ago and was growing dozens of indica, sativa and hybrids and learned how to breed them to make new strains also bought some seeds from attitudes seeds and few other seed breeders and also been cloning to create my own mother plants to give some clones for friends and dispensaries in Northern California. Had been trimming since when I got my first approved recommendation so I have almost 8 years of experience. Can trim up to 8-16 ounces a day and faster with a trimmer machine. I can work only part time like up to $1100. a month.","contact":"coolart3@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-31T05:16:05.829Z"}
