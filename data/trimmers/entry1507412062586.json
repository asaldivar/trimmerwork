My name is Adrian and i just moved here from Miami, Florida about 6 months ago. I have been trimming cannabis in total now for about 1.5 years. I have done wet/dry trim, bucking, big leafing, and other cannabis related tasks. I also lived in Denver a few years ago and did a lot of feeding as well as trimming there too. I'm currently still trimming for the same company I started with when I moved here, but looking for something better. I currently work Monday-Friday 8-4:30 with weekends off.","contact":"Email - dtracingrivals@gmail.com Phone # 5034966311","date":"2017-10-07T21:34:22.586Z"}
