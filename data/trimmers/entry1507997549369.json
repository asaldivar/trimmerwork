We been married 15 years and are best friends. We sold everything we own and bought a pop up and truck to move here to learn this industry. In route the top blew off the pop up. A truck hit the top and threw a piece in my face. We lost nearly everything and the feeling in my face. We are dedicated to being here. We need a place to stay and meals but would be on site 24/7. We are very clean and respectful and in need of work and a safe place to stay.
