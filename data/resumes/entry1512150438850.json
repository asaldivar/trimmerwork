I feel like l would be able to bring a lot to the table because I have fun trimming buds and i really love being around a lot of weed as well as two years of security experience, a year of university education where i spent my summer trimming buds part time. I have met and learned from patients in various places in California but wish to know more about collectives. I also have an overall basic knowledge about medical marijuana due to my living in the bay area, LA and humboldt county.
