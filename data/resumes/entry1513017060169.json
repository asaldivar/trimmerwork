It has always been my dream to move to the Pacific Northwest and after I graduated college I saw an opportunity to grasp my dreams and turn them into reality. I have been working in the customer service industry for over 10 years, mostly food service, but also IT/computer help desk attendant, cash-only greenhouse cashier, catering/delivery driver, and bartending. As a result, I have learned impeccable cash handling and merchandising techniques, I understand and can flow seamlessly though most POS systems, and have working knowledge on how to handle customers and work on a team respectfully, with a positive attitude.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving here, for me, is the idea that you can do anything you dream of as long as you work hard and set realistic goals for yourself. I am a naturally happy person with a positive work ethic and a smile that could brighten your day from across the room. I intend to turn my passion for cannabis into a career that not only benefits the company but also our customers and patients who rely on us daily. I have handled and enjoyed learning about cannabis in various forms my whole adult life, but moving to a legal state gives me a unique opportunity to expand my knowledge. Since relocating I have acquired my OLCC Marijuana Workers Permit and I am very excited at the prospect of taking my knowledge and skills to the next level.</p>","experience":"<p><strong>Karben4 Brewing (2015-2017)</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>3698 Kinsman Blvd. Madison, WI 53704</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shift Leader</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specializes in craft beer (Madison’s #1 3 years in a row)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly became one of 5 Shift Leaders involved in training and maintaining</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed all calls and concerns most nights as upper management only worked days</p><p>\t<strong>Famous Dave’s (2011-2015)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;900 South Park St. Madison, WI 53715</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartender/Server</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trained new bartenders/servers</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran many Catering/delivery orders, including sold out Badger football games</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specializes in barbeque and comfort foods</p><p><strong>Irish Lane Greenhouse’s (2010-2012)</strong></p><p>5555 Irish Lane Fitchburg, WI 53711</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handled the cash only register</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeder/Planter/Water/Miscellaneous tasks</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Greenhouse, manager trusted me to watch the whole place on my own</p><p><strong>Meriter Hospital (2007-2009)</strong></p><p>202 South Park St. Madison, WI 53715</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intern for IT department during high school (School to Work Program)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uploaded image software for all hospital computers and studied IT skills</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivered and set-up computers for employees in their offices</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gained DECA Student of the Month through School to Work achievements</p>","additionalInfo":"<p>I also love to garden and could help out with all parts of grow process!
