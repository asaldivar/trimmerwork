I Feel I would make a great addition to your team! First and foremost, out of every dispensary I have been to (Many!) you always carry the highest quality cannabis products. The Staff is always helpful, knowledgeable, kind and compassionate. It is always a relaxed and professional experience visiting your dispensary. I love the laid back and clean atmosphere.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am knowledgeable about the products you sell as I already have a lot of experience when it comes to cannabis (be it strains, practical application of products, edibles and their effects, etc.). I am a very fast learner and will have no problem learning about any and all of the wonderful additional cannabis products you offer. I will also provide the same knowledgeable, kind and professional demeanor for clientele as your current team of professionals. In addition to these skills, I also have over 13 years of customer service experience that is a skill in which cannot be taught but rather must be learned first hand. I love helping others and by being a part of your team feel that is exactly what I would be doing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a strong advocate for marijuana, even being part of the 2016 OR Cannabis Cup as a sales Representative and promoter in addition to serving over 1,100 customers at New Vansterdam Cannabis Market on 4/20/2017 (plus the 21<sup>st</sup>-the 22<sup>nd</sup> as we celebrated with an entire weekend of sales). I believe in cannabis being incorporated into a healthy and happy lifestyle and am excited to watch the cannabis community grow. Cannabis has virtually cured my chronic body pain issues and aided me in losing over 150lbs since June of 2016, so I am very passionate when it comes to cannabis and its many uses for a happy, healthy and fun lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently available for Full Time work and I would love the opportunity to be a part of your team and that experience. I also am an OLCC Marijuana Worker Permit card-holder (A copy is attached to my resume for your convenience). Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I truly look forward to hearing from you soon!</p><p><br></p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p><br></p><p>Jamie G.
