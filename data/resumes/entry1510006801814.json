I’m 24 and moved to LA (from AZ) a few years ago after graduating college. While in college, I was hit by a drunk driver and luckily walked away in one piece; But, after the accident I started to developed chronic back pain. I eventually realized I was fed up with pain killers and decided to try medical marijuana and it changed everything for me. Since then, I’ve become passionate about learning as much as I can about marijuana and business and hope to one day open my own dispensary. \r\nWith that being said, I want my first steps to be working at/helping another dispensary grow!","experience":"Server-Present (Over a Year)\r\nCatering- 1+ years\r\nMarketing Manager- 2yrs\r\nStore Manager-1yr\r\nStore Associate-2yrs","additionalInfo":"","contact":"marissalobos@email.arizona.edu","date":"2017-11-06T22:20:01.814Z"}
