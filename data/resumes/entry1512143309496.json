I have been a longtime marijuana smoker, and have recently gotten into home-growing, trimming, curing, and smoking my own product. However, it's only been in small doses so far, and in my free time, but think I'd like to make a career out of the marijuana industry. I took the test about a week ago, I passed with a 28/30 score. I am waiting for approval from the OLCC, but my certification is #8061279. I would love to be apart of your business, have attached my resume, and look forward to hopefully hearing back from you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you,</strong></p><p><strong>Michael Broderick</strong></p>","experience":"<p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Rontoms</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Prep cook/dishwasher May 2017-Present</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Local Harvest Eatery &amp; Pub </strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Kitchen and Server March 2016-April 2017</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>CB Quality Maintenance</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">General Home/Apartment Maintenance from August 2015-March 2016</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>Squaregator Inc.</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Daycare Teacher from September 2014-January 2016</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p>","additionalInfo":"<p><br></p>","contact":"broderickm01@gmail.com","date":"2017-12-01T15:48:29.496Z"}
