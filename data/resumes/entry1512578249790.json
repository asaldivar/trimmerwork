I'm an NYU student taking some time off school and looking for fun work to spend my time on.  At school I am on the Dean's List, earning a GPA of 3.7, and out of school I am just as dedicated to my work. I want to be a bud tender because I want to work with and around products that I enjoy and support.  I trained for a bud tending position for 15 hours a few months ago before deciding to pursue other work.  I am now looking to get back into the service industry.  I know my skills and personality would be a wonderful addition to any team.  I'm a quick-learner and an enthusiastic salesperson.  I've been a weed consumer since I got my medical recommendation when I turned 18, and I'm confident in my knowledge of the products and their effects.  I look forward to hearing back from you guys.</p>","experience":"<p>-Cashier at LACMA's coffee shop February-July 2016</p><p>-Babysitter 2012- present</p>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"beanmiller@me.com","date":"2017-12-06T16:37:29.790Z","slug":"budtender","tags":[""]}
