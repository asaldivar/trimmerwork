Customer service is my expertise and medical marijuana is an industry that I feel most passionate about. I’m excited about the rapid growth of this industry and want nothing more than to be apart of it. I’m a fast learner and love to ask questions to become a more knowledgeable employee. I'm currently working in an Optometrists office and would love to switch to something a little more exciting! I have basic knowledge in flower and have had plenty experiences with edibles to be able to determine a safe dosage. Looking forward for the chance to sit down and speak further about the many possibilities!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nGenovieve Mai Fiaseu","experience":"Granada Hills Optometry  - Current\r\n-Office Assistant/Receptionist\r\n\r\nLAUSD\r\nNov 2015 - June 2017\r\n-Program Supervisor: Dance Coach\r\n\r\nPetCo\r\nFeb 2014 - Nov 2015\r\n-Lead Dog Trainer","additionalInfo":"I currently work in an Optometrists office so I check patients in and collect payment on their way out.
