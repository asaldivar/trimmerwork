When I was young I followed the whole legalization of weed and even did a report on the benefits of the measure being passed. I've always enjoyed plants and the process of the growth. I have patiently awaited my 21st birthday to legally work within the cannabis business. Cannabis is used as medicine too.  Which is the other field of my interest. So I feel like this opportunity to work with trimmers is my foot in the door to my career.  </p>","experience":"<ul><li>Levy Restaurants 12/2015-11/2016</li><li>Subway  12/2016- 6/2017</li><li>Wendy's  5/2017- 10/2017</li></ul>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"laderoute.kay96len@gmail.com","date":"2017-12-05T07:15:42.764Z","slug":"budtender","tags":[""]}
