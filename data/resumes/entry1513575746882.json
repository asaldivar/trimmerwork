I have worked at 5 different dispensaries and helped a family member in Washington state open one up with a grow house. I am familiar with many products such as flower, concentrates, tinctures, topicals, edibles, and gear etc as well as many different brands in the industry. I have been promoted at every job I have worked and believe I could be an essential member to your team.</p>","experience":"<p>VMC, AMG, MK Wellness, KTC, Pretty Ladied Collective, &amp; more:</p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">Responsibilities included extensive marijuana and &nbsp;product knowledge on all of our products which included flower, concentrates, edibles, tinctures, topicals, etc. Cleaning the shop, great customer service and restocking our products were also essential to the job, as well as taking inventory and counting out drawers. I trained new employees and handled customer related issues, spoke with and paid vendors and also updated our weedmaps and ran our social media accounts. Verifying IDâ€™s and Recs and performing other receptionist duties like scanning documents, making lables etc. were jobs I also performed here. While there were many other duties necessary to work at these locations, those are some main jobs I performed. The longest I worked for a shop was one year, the shortest was 3 months. Any of the jobs that I have worked at for a few months have always been known to be temporary or I moved to a new city.</span></p>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"202 441 1059","date":"2017-12-18T05:42:26.881Z"}
