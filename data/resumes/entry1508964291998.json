I've had marjiuana in my life for about 6 years now and got my Rec as soon as i could. Marijuana helps me in many ways with my anxiety and diet and I love reading about all the ways it helps people. I have extensive customer service and cash handling experience. I love working with and around people and I'm always looking for ways to better myself! I would love the chance to get involved in this community so I can gain knowledge so i can hopefully open my own dispensary + hash bar one day!","experience":"- Daisy Duke's Express, New Orleans, LA, March 2017 - October 2017\r\n- Shake Shack, West Hollywood, CA, March 2016 - March 2017\r\n- Walmart, Salem, OR, October 2015 - December 2015\r\n- Walmart, Warrenton, MO, June 201 5 - October 2015\r\n- Flying J, Warrenton, MO, June 2015 - October 2015\r\n- Denny's, Warrenton, MO, February 2015 - June 2015 \r\n- Olive Garden, Wentzville, MO, October 2014 - February 2015\r\n- Flying J, Warrenton, MO, February 2014 - October 2014\r\n- Pizzahut, Corona, CA, June 2011 - February 2013","additionalInfo":"Extensive cash handling, customer service, customer satisfaction,","contact":"angelagrock@yahoo.com or 323-271-9631","date":"2017-10-25T20:44:51.998Z","timestamp":1508964291}
