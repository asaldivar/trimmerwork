Making me bilingual in German fluently. With a sincere passion and ambition towards film from a very young age, I always knew where my final destination would be, and always had the concrete plan. To move to Los Angeles and pursue and obtain a career in some capacity in the film industry. \r\n\r\nI started out studying Film at the New York Film Academy at Universal. Although it was a fantastic experience, I still maintain that one could really only learn best with first hand experiences on set. I’ve got an invaluable amount of Customer Service skills to match up with my positivity, and absolutely love working in teams, however I have no problem hitting the ground running, since I’m a definite self-starter, and won’t really need my hand held. Apart from that, I’m always punctual and organized and I’d be stoked to hear back from you, so we could get started as soon as possible. Of course I do also possess my medical card, and am pretty knowledgable when it comes to strains, edibles, and cartridges.\r\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nI am available at your request for an interview any time – any day, I’m flexible and have open availability.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully, \r\n\r\nMatisse Mazur \r\n(818) 406-0118","experience":"Experience\r\n\r\nJanuary 12, 2017 – July 1, 2017\r\nHost | Hard Rock Cafe | Hollywood, CA\r\n\r\nCustomer Service & Support, Seating, Restrooms, Inventory, Answering Incoming Phone Calls, Accepting Deliveries, Setting Up Tables, Bussing Assistance, Dealing with Priority Seaters/Reservations.\r\n\r\nJune 11, 2014 – January 31, 2016\r\nHost | Hard Rock Café | Vienna, Austria\r\n\r\nCustomer Service & Support, Seating, Restrooms, Inventory, Answering Incoming Phone Calls, Accepting Deliveries, Setting Up Tables, Bussing Assistance, Dealing with Priority Seaters/Reservations, Training New Employees.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2012 – March 10, 2014\r\nGSR/OPC Agent | Wyndham Resorts | Anaheim, CA\r\n\r\nWorking All Major Sporting/Entertainment Events, Booking Tours for our Resort in Exchange for Vacation Packages/Gifts/Incentives.
