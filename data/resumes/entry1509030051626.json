I am Emily (aka PurplinaRolls) and am seeking continued employment in this amazing industry. I have bud tended since 2009 (Hot Box Collective, LA) and been an enthusiastic experimenter with edibles and extractions this entire century. I've had several independent clients with myriad ailments use my edibles as medicine over the years. Most recently, I budtended/canna-catered a long time business partner's wedding. Truffles, Almond Bark, Fudge, 200 Joints, and 100 Blunts in preparation, followed by actively running the Cannabis Lounge throughout the reception. During which time, dab rigs, bowls, and bongs were in operation as well as keeping up with the jars on the menu and consulting guests on strains apropos to desired effects. \r\nI have worked in the service industry my whole adult life, and also in marketing research. I am extremely well versed, and enthusiastic in this particular market and look forward to furthering my career within it.
