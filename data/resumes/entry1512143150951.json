I have worked at a grow house growing the product and curing it and drying it. I have also went around to shops to sell pounds to the shops. I can grow it and I can sell it. I try my best to stay faithful to my employers if they treat me with respect but if I'm not treated with respect I don't show respect and would quit because that's not the kind of environment I would want to work in.
