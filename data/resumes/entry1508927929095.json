(Like everyone else and their mom, haha) I started budtending a year after I moved here. I’ve worked in shops in Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Hollywood, Redondo Beach, Anaheim, Inglewood, and South Central. I enjoy the atmosphere inside a dispensary. It’s always fun, and everyone is usually in a good mood. I like to help patients with not only their medical needs, but also help them relieve their stress while they’re inside the shop by getting their minds off their problems.","experience":"• OG Top Shop\r\nBudtender / March-May\r\n\r\n•Kings of Gas\r\nBudtender/Team Lead / May-August\r\n\r\n•Anaheim Daily Greens\r\nBudtender / January-March\r\n\r\n•MedEx\r\nBudtender/Manager August-December 2016","additionalInfo":"","contact":"Taddgrant3@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-25T10:38:49.094Z"}
