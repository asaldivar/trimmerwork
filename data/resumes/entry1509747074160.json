I started working in the Cannabis Industry about  two months ago and I can honestly say I loved the experience so much. I like how through working you somewhat form a small community while still being refreshed with new faces every shift. I learn things from the patients and these past months have felt like my own self conducted social experiment! It has been really exciting watching my progress as well. I've devoted time to learn products names and look up reviews to know whats popular/ in demand. I can really see myself growing in the Cannabis Industry thats why I am in search of a shop I can see my self thriving in. A BADASS SHOP.","experience":"South Bay Organics - 2months\r\nMerchLabs - 1 year\r\nMacys- 1 year","additionalInfo":"Bilingual (Spanish)","contact":"aimejanelle@gmail.com","date":"2017-11-03T22:11:14.160Z"}
