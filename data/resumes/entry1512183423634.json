And the urgency to leave was not only from the want/need to relax and smoke. But the whole process from going to the shop for an eighth to breaking up my swisher, even the sound the grinder makes as it rips apart my medicine. </p><p>Truth is I'm more than just a smoker, a weed enthusiast. I 100% believe in the business and I'm ready to invest all myself into this growing business. I've seen first hand how it can help anyone from a child to my family dog. </p><p>I cant help to feel like I am missing out on possibly the biggest opportunity of my era. </p><p><br></p><p>I enjoy work behind the scenes, in the operations side of the business please don't misread me. I'm a team player and will always give every job I have 110%. However, at 24, I'd like to be give my 110% work to a company I'm passionate about. </p>","experience":"<p>Like stated above, I've only had office jobs. Working as receptionist to customer relations to handling the returns department. </p><p><br></p><p>In total I have had 2 jobs working at a dispensary which lasted a total of a month (both included). I did not believe in the way these 2 dispensaries did business.</p>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"Angulomichi93@gmail.com","date":"2017-12-02T02:57:03.634Z"}
