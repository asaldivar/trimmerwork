Working for high-line auto dealers for the past three years I've become accustomed to building relationships with high profile customers with high standards for both quality and time-management. My full retail experience spans over ten years in industries such as banking and retail fashion. My current position, while it provides an air of luxury, is lacking in providing me a sense of purpose and passion. I am seeking a position in the cannabis industry because beyond being a recreational customer, I am a strong supporter of cannabis use in healthcare in lieu of traditional pharmaceuticals and hope to one day become an integral player in the cause. I look forward to meeting you in person.</p><p><br></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><br></p><p>Whitney Buehler</p>","experience":"<ul><li>Sales Consultant- Rusnak Maserati   August 2017-Present</li><li>Senior Sales Assistant- McKenna BMW/Porsche/Audi  August 2015-August 2017</li><li>Corporate Relations Assistant- Outfest Los Angeles  April 2015-July 2015</li><li>Barista/Barista Trainer- Starbucks  June 2014-April 2015</li><li>Internet Sales Director- Mercedes-Benz of Kansas City  March 2014-April 2015</li></ul>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"whitneymbuehler@gmail.com","date":"2017-12-01T22:09:37.810Z"}
