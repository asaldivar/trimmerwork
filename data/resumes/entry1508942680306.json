I have worked for dogs in the past for almost two years so ill know how to handle difficult tasks if any. I also work part-time as a non-armed security at big events so i know how to have fun and talk to customers to the point where they feel more like our friends than security. Ive never worked for a marijuana dispensary before but ive had a rec for 4yrs. I have always made conversation with the budtenders to make the environment fun and make their work place less boring if their days was heading that way so ill do the same if i was the one on the other side of the counter. And if i havent mentioned already, ill always be eager to learn in this field and will always have a positive attitude!","experience":"-Summer Night Lights\r\n-Dog watcher at a non-kill shelter\r\n-Crew Member at a Doggy day care and boarding facility\r\n-Crew Member at a fruit and vegetable warehouse\r\n-Non-armed security","additionalInfo":"","contact":"C.castro1716@yahoo.com","date":"2017-10-25T14:44:40.306Z"}
