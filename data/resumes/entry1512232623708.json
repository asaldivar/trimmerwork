I have a passion for the industry as my family is \"in Raymond\" if that means much to ya. I've been a bong salesman before and love hooking up the fellow smoker. I've dabbled at opening my own shop for my personal collection. I'm currently a full time student for collision repair as driving in the Oregon Rally X circuit is my summer job. I'm a very outgoing and unique individual that can bring a special type of tenacity to any team. </p>","experience":"<p>I've worked customer service jobs while in school or over the summer but mostly peddling bongs!
