My name phalicia williams, i always wanted to work as a budtender but really didn't know where to look or start, i have never worked in a shop before but i always go to get weed so i see the ladys/men and see how they work. I know how to do the basics when it comes down to being a budtender, i know its not complicated but i know i would need a little more training. I am a fast learner also uplifting and a always outgoing person, i love to smoke so I know pretty much everything about marijuana. I know i wont let you guys down if you give me a chance i can prove to you that you picked the right person to be on your team. I would appreciate it if you could get back to me asap. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. </p>","experience":"<p>•grocery market before </p><p>• fast food restaurants </p>","additionalInfo":"","contact":"Phaliciawilliams14@icloud.com","date":"2017-12-30T21:11:57.209Z"}
