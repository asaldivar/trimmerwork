He holds a B.A. in Psychology from California State University-Northridge, an M.S. in Clinical Psychology and an M.B.A. in International Business from California Lutheran University, as well as an M.A. in Politics from Claremont Graduate University. He is a political scholar, and is also an accomplished musician, having performed numerous classical masterworks as a member of the choir at Pomona College. He works as a consultant.</p>\n<p>Kelan was a longtime Democrat, having voted for Gore in 2000, Kerry in 2004, and Obama in 2008 and 2012. He supported the notion of a female President, and was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren in 2016. When it became public knowledge that the Hillary Clinton campaign had colluded with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, former Democratic Party Chairperson, to prevent Warren and Bernie Sanders from competing with Hillary on an even playing field in the 2016 Democratic primaries, Kelan became enraged with the Democratic Party, switched parties, and ultimately voted for Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>After watching Trump&apos;s performance in The White House for the past year (lots of controversies, firings, etc.), Kelan regrets his decision to vote for Trump, and has decided to go right at him by running as a Republican. He contemplated running as a Democrat, because he supports LGBTA+ equality, inclusion in the workplace, and the legalization of medicinal cannabis, but feels that it would be more efficient to challenge Donald Trump directly as a Republican, given the fact that many Republicans are dismayed by Donald Trump&apos;s short tenure in office.</p>\n<p>Kelan was educated by many prominent conservative (and liberal) professors while a doctoral student at Claremont, and respects the opinions of both parties, as Americans.</p>\n<p>Kelan&apos;s primary campaign platform is that of true campaign finance reform consisting of equal funding for all presidential candidates, because he thinks that every constitutionally eligible person should be given a chance to run for political office, not just the rich and the famous.</p>\n<p>Currently, Mr. Farrell-Smith&apos;s campaign is seeking motivated political interns who would like to see real change in Washington, DC.

He holds a B.A. in Psychology from California State University-Northridge, an M.S. in Clinical Psychology and an M.B.A. in International Business from California Lutheran University, as well as an M.A. in Politics from Claremont Graduate University. He is a political scholar, and is also an accomplished musician, having performed numerous classical masterworks as a member of the choir at Pomona College.</p>\n<p>He works as a consultant.</p>\n<p>Kelan was a longtime Democrat, having voted for Gore in 2000, Kerry in 2004, and Obama in 2008 and 2012. He supported the notion of a female President, and was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren in 2016. When it became public knowledge that the Hillary Clinton campaign had colluded with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, former Democratic Party Chairperson, to prevent Warren and Bernie Sanders from competing with Hillary on an even playing field in the 2016 Democratic primaries, Kelan became enraged with the Democratic Party, switched parties, and ultimately voted for Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>After watching Trump&apos;s performance in The White House for the past year (lots of controversies, firings, etc.), Kelan regrets his decision to vote for Trump, and has decided to go right at him by running as a Republican. He contemplated running as a Democrat, because he supports LGBTA+ equality, inclusion in the workplace, and the legalization of medicinal cannabis, but feels that it would be more efficient to challenge Donald Trump directly as a Republican, given the fact that many Republicans are dismayed by Donald Trump&apos;s short tenure in office.</p>\n<p>Kelan was educated by many prominent conservative (and liberal) professors while a doctoral student at Claremont, and respects the opinions of both parties, as Americans.</p>\n<p>Kelan&apos;s primary campaign platform is that of true campaign finance reform consisting of equal funding for all presidential candidates, because he thinks that every constitutionally eligible person should be given a chance to run for political office, not just the rich and the famous.</p>\n<p>Currently, Mr. Farrell-Smith&apos;s campaign is seeking motivated political interns who would like to see real change in Washington, DC. He favors the idea that being educated in politics should outweigh being rich or famous, at least as far as presidential campaigns are concerned.</p>\n<p>Job responsibilities: cold calling, polling, fundraising, etc.</p>\n<p>Work experience: no prior political campaign experience is required</p>\n<p>Required education: a bachelor&apos;s or master&apos;s degree in political science, politics, constitutional law, or political philosophy (political theory) is preferred, however current undergraduate college students in those fields, as well as other related fields, are encouraged to apply</p>\n<p>Job Types: Full-time, Part-time</p>\n<p>Required education:</p>\n<ul><li>High school or equivalent</li></ul></span></p>\n\n                \n                \n                    <h4 class=\"margin-bottom-10\">","jobLocation":"Los Angeles, California","_id":"17d7b2f2a2b03a96d0a5b2e0935b0b7390821aea","date":" Nov 19,2017","jobApplication":"https://420jobsearch.com/job-political-campaign-intern-california-los-angeles-t8o"},

He holds a B.A. in Psychology from California State University-Northridge, an M.S. in Clinical Psychology and an M.B.A. in International Business from California Lutheran University, as well as an M.A. in Politics from Claremont Graduate University. He is a political scholar, and is also an accomplished musician, having performed numerous classical masterworks as a member of the choir at Pomona College. He works as a consultant.</p>\n<p>Kelan was a longtime Democrat, having voted for Gore in 2000, Kerry in 2004, and Obama in 2008 and 2012. He supported the notion of a female President, and was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren in 2016. When it became public knowledge that the Hillary Clinton campaign had colluded with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, former Democratic Party Chairperson, to prevent Warren and Bernie Sanders from competing with Hillary on an even playing field in the 2016 Democratic primaries, Kelan became enraged with the Democratic Party, switched parties, and ultimately voted for Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>After watching Trump&apos;s performance in The White House for the past year (lots of controversies, firings, etc.), Kelan regrets his decision to vote for Trump, and has decided to go right at him by running as a Republican. He contemplated running as a Democrat, because he supports LGBTA+ equality, inclusion in the workplace, and the legalization of medicinal cannabis, but feels that it would be more efficient to challenge Donald Trump directly as a Republican, given the fact that many Republicans are dismayed by Donald Trump&apos;s short tenure in office.</p>\n<p>Kelan was educated by many prominent conservative (and liberal) professors while a doctoral student at Claremont, and respects the opinions of both parties, as Americans.</p>\n<p>Kelan&apos;s primary campaign platform is that of true campaign finance reform consisting of equal funding for all presidential candidates, because he thinks that every constitutionally eligible person should be given a chance to run for political office, not just the rich and the famous.</p>\n<p>Currently, Mr. Farrell-Smith&apos;s campaign is seeking motivated political interns who would like to see real change in Washington, DC.

{"companyName":"Kelan John Farrell-Smith for President in 2020","jobTitle":"Political Campaign Intern","jobType":"Full-Time","jobDescription":"<p class=\"job-full-descr\"><span id=\"job_summary\" class=\"summary\"><p>This job posting is aimed towards hiring unpaid (at first) interns for a 2020 United States Presidential Campaign.</p>\n<p>Kelan John Farrell-Smith (R-CA) is a true Washington outsider, not rich or famous in any way, but is a young, 35-year-old political up-and-comer who is tired of seeing the same few (unqualified) families being promoted for political office by the media. He holds a B.A. in Psychology from California State University-Northridge, an M.S. in Clinical Psychology and an M.B.A. in International Business from California Lutheran University, as well as an M.A. in Politics from Claremont Graduate University. He is a political scholar, and is also an accomplished musician, having performed numerous classical masterworks as a member of the choir at Pomona College.</p>\n<p>He works as a consultant.</p>\n<p>Kelan was a longtime Democrat, having voted for Gore in 2000, Kerry in 2004, and Obama in 2008 and 2012. He supported the notion of a female President, and was a supporter of Elizabeth Warren in 2016. When it became public knowledge that the Hillary Clinton campaign had colluded with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, former Democratic Party Chairperson, to prevent Warren and Bernie Sanders from competing with Hillary on an even playing field in the 2016 Democratic primaries, Kelan became enraged with the Democratic Party, switched parties, and ultimately voted for Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>After watching Trump&apos;s performance in The White House for the past year (lots of controversies, firings, etc.), Kelan regrets his decision to vote for Trump, and has decided to go right at him by running as a Republican. He contemplated running as a Democrat, because he supports LGBTA+ equality, inclusion in the workplace, and the legalization of medicinal cannabis, but feels that it would be more efficient to challenge Donald Trump directly as a Republican, given the fact that many Republicans are dismayed by Donald Trump&apos;s short tenure in office.</p>\n<p>Kelan was educated by many prominent conservative (and liberal) professors while a doctoral student at Claremont, and respects the opinions of both parties, as Americans.</p>\n<p>Kelan&apos;s primary campaign platform is that of true campaign finance reform consisting of equal funding for all presidential candidates, because he thinks that every constitutionally eligible person should be given a chance to run for political office, not just the rich and the famous.</p>\n<p>Currently, Mr. Farrell-Smith&apos;s campaign is seeking motivated political interns who would like to see real change in Washington, DC. He favors the idea that being educated in politics should outweigh being rich or famous, at least as far as presidential campaigns are concerned.</p>\n<p>Job responsibilities: cold calling, polling, fundraising, etc.</p>\n<p>Work experience: no prior political campaign experience is required</p>\n<p>Required education: a bachelor&apos;s or master&apos;s degree in political science, politics, constitutional law, or political philosophy (political theory) is preferred, however current undergraduate college students in those fields, as well as other related fields, are encouraged to apply</p>\n<p>Job Types: Full-time, Part-time</p>\n<p>Required education:</p>\n<ul><li>High school or equivalent</li></ul></span></p>\n\n                \n                \n                    <h4 class=\"margin-bottom-10\">","jobLocation":"Los Angeles, California","_id":"5283e4f2cf138fc335f2055d756470de684f5d10","date":" Nov 19,2017","jobApplication":"https://420jobsearch.com/job-political-campaign-intern-california-los-angeles-t8o"},
