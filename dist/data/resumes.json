I am interested in working in the cannabis industry because I believe cannabis as a commodity carries sufficient strength/force to make total national legalization a reality. For the past year I have worked in the cannabis industry for Sho Products/Rosin Tech. Sho products specializes on heat presses and so call \" solvent-less extraction\". Under this company my  main duties were to assemble and manufacture heat presses and pollen extraction machines ( tumblers). In the past three months, I was responsible for building Sho products' new press the Rosin Roller under the Sho Industries brand. The Rosin Roller's retail price was  $ 7,000, and it was considered to be the new innovation in solvent-less extraction. .  I also helped with shipping and organizing merchandise in the main distribution  warehouse. I worked  trade shows such as High Times' Cannabis Cub, Champs, Emerald Cup, and Chalice.   My responsibilities during the trade shows were to interact and inform costumers about extraction machines and perform  live rosin extraction using heat presses. I also helped with set up and break down of tents and equipment. Due to  Sho Products' small staff  I was able to gain experience in several other  sectors: from costumer service, manufacturing, stocking,  picking and organizing out going orders,taking inventory and shipping orders  using software such as Google Docs, spread sheet, and  shipstation. I also possess Microsoft office knowledge ( mainly word, excel, and power point); not to mention that I am always incline to learn new software when ever the opportunity to do so presents itself. I also consider myself computer savvy.  Because such limited staff, I was expected to do perform different task and prioritize urgent requests.

My duties as a budtender here was to assist all new/returning patients, stock the shelves, fill jars, check patients in and out, keep the cleanliness, make sure I give the patients their daily deals or even give them the best deal they can receive by upscaling. Unfortunately I had to leave due to the shop being bought by a different owner. </p>","additionalInfo":"<p>I really enjoyed and loved working for this MMJ collective and being in the industry itself. I want to expand with working with an industry like this because I enjoy and love it. I believe people/patients should receive the best customer service all the time. It is our job as the workers/budtenders to assist any customer with any need of theirs. I wish to work at another Collective very soon and hopefully be given the chance to be taught about this industry even further. </p>","contact":"Cjayde08@icloud.com","date":"2017-12-04T06:42:42.969Z","slug":"budtender","tags":["user-generated"]},{"_id":"ea087e90-d8cd-11e7-84b8-65f7ac69ee30","name":"Wendy Linan","poster_email":"Eferlinan@gmail.com","location":"Los Angeles Ca","title":"Bud Tender","jobCategory":"Sales","references":"true","coverLetter":"<p>Wendy Linan</p><p>1029 s Union ave #14 LA, CA 90015</p><p>(323) 396 4616</p><p>eferlinan@gmail.com</p><p>SKILLS</p><p>Language: Fluent in English and Spanish (Able to Translate)</p><p>Computer/Technology: Proficient in Microsoft - Word, PowerPoint, and Excel</p><p>Customer Service, Fast learner, Communication Skills&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>EXPERIENCE</p><p>Talent Escort&nbsp;</p><p>Latin American Music Awards&nbsp;</p><p>American Idol Finale&nbsp;</p><p>TV Land Icon Awards&nbsp;</p><p>Teen Choice Awards</p><p>The Espys</p><p>●\tReceive/ Escort talent at venue&nbsp;</p><p>●\tAssist talent/ management with their needs&nbsp;</p><p>●\tLiaison between production and talent/ management&nbsp;</p><p>Tom’s Urban</p><p>Hostess&nbsp;</p><p>●\tGreeting guest&nbsp;</p><p>●\tMaking sure guest feel welcome</p><p>●\tMonitored dinning room and guest flow to maximize table usage and minimize customer wait times.</p><p>●\tAnswered phone calls, booked reservations</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>Alexander Hamilton High School - Los Angeles, CA&nbsp;</p><p>- High School Diploma June 2015</p><p><br></p><p>VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE&nbsp;</p><p>Youth Leader - Los Angeles, CA</p><p>Salvation Army Red Shield&nbsp;</p><p>●\tSupervised children and all their needs&nbsp;</p><p>●\tAssisted group leaders with activities ;

At school I am on the Dean's List, earning a GPA of 3.7, and out of school I am just as dedicated to my work. I want to be a bud tender because I want to work with and around products that I enjoy and support.  I trained for a bud tending position for 15 hours a few months ago before deciding to pursue other work.  I am now looking to get back into the service industry.  I know my skills and personality would be a wonderful addition to any team.  I'm a quick-learner and an enthusiastic salesperson.  I've been a weed consumer since I got my medical recommendation when I turned 18, and I'm confident in my knowledge of the products and their effects.
